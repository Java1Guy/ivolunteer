      <Name>Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly</Name>
      <Description>Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly (LBFE) is an international non-profit volunteer-based organization committed to relieving isolation and loneliness among the elderly.  We offer, to people of goodwill, the opportunity to join the elderly in friendship and celebration of life.  

"Flowers Before Bread", the spirit of our mission rests on a belief that basic human needs such as food and shelter fall short of what our elders deserve.  Companionship, an opportunity to retain independence, a sense of belonging, a sense of mattering, of being listened to, of being understood, of having a voice; these are the dignities our elder citizens deserve.</Description>

  <Description>A great one-time opportunity for a small group of volunteers! Gather together 2-4 friends, coworkers, or family members for this festive event! 

Organize a Halloween game of Bingo for residents at the Continental Hotel, a building that houses 70 formerly-homeless adults. We provide the Bingo set; you provide the prizes and snacks!

Snacks can be as simple as homemade cookies and coffee or chips and soda. You will also need to supply plates, cups, and napkins.

Prizes can be anything our residents would find useful or enjoyable. Small dollar-store items are great, but the skys the limit. Please bring about 30 items. Suggested prizes include:
 Household supplies: dish soap, dish towels, sponges, laundry soap, mops, brooms, fresh-air spray, toilet paper, garbage bags, other cleaning supplies
 Incense or scented candles 
 Self-care items: shampoo, lip balm, lotion, body wash
 Board games
 Linens: bath towels, blankets, pillows

  <Description>No experience necessary! Just come with patience and a desire to help students succeed!

Work one-on-one or in a small group with 6th grade English Language Learners. Listen to students as they read, correct their pronunciation, and check for students understanding of the material. The students have conversational English skills but on average, are two years behind grade level in their reading ability. An hour might not seem like a lot, but it is helping these students get the extra "reading boost" they need. 

Minimum age to volunteer for this project is 18. For more information about Reading Boost, contact Renae at 612-379-4900 x 15</Description>

  <Description>The traveling nationwide Say Boo! to the Flu tour will be stopping in Minneapolis at the Mall of America on Sunday, Oct. 19th!  Nurses from the Minnesota Visiting Nurse Agency will administer vaccinations to the whole family and teach them how to help prevent the spread of the flu virus all season.  

There will also be fun, interactive games for families to learn how to help prevent the spread of the flu virus.  Kids quickly forget about a flu vaccination when they are getting their faces painted or dressed in Halloween costumes!

Volunteers will be asked to assist with crowd control, greeting families who stop by for a flu shot, and overseeing activities for kids.

Please contact Ana Kari at karia@mvna.org or 612-617-4655, if interested!

  <Description>Did you know that two medium-sized trees supply all the oxygen one person needs for a year? Planting trees is a great way to improve your local environment, engage in your community, and breathe a bit easier. Thanks to a challenge grant from an anonymous local family foundation, Tree Trust hopes to engage volunteers to plant up to 2,000 trees in the Twin Cities. We will kick off this effort on Saturday, October 18, 2008 at the bike trail near Belt Line Blvd. and Highway 7 in St. Louis Park. 

Dont worry if youve never planted a tree before - we will demonstrate the correct technique, and trained volunteers will be there to answer your questions and provide assistance. Children and dogs are welcome (if well-behaved). For more information or to register for the event, please email Jessica S. at jessicas@treetrust.org or call her at 651-644-5800.

  <Description>Great River Greening is entering its 11th year of work at the Xcel Energy plant. This year, 300 volunteers will plant trees, seedlings, and shrubs in order to close a gap in the forest canopy in an effort to help ensure the ecological health of the surrounding floodplain forest and Mississippi River. The planting will help ensure the health of a rich diversity of plant and animal life. The closed canopy will also help improve wild bird habitat and encourage the return of endangered bird populations. The project as a whole helps protect the water quality of the Mississippi River which positively impacts the entire metro area water shed.</Description>

  <Title>Peace, Power and Unity Conference Volunteers -Multiple Positions</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.handsontwincities.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=3133&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description> 	

The Freedom Summer of 1964 was an important part of the Civil Rights Movement. In the same spirit, we are organizing this one-day Peace, Power, and Unity Conference to connect community leaders from across the metropolitan area, provide educational workshops on addressing important community issues, and concentrate community engagement resources in a new way. The conference will take place on Saturday, October 18 at The Plymouth Christian Youth Center in North Minneapolis.

Volunteers are needed in multiple different roles to make this event happen. We are looking for volunteers to help register attendees, serve lunch, direct parking, direct attendees to workshops during the conference, and supervise children while their parents attend workshops. Some volunteers with Spanish, Hmong, or Somali language skills are also needed. These language skills are not, however, required to volunteer. 

Many of these positions would afford individuals the oppurtunity to attend workshops and participate in the conference in addition to volunteering!

Conference workshop topics include Immigration Policy, Tenants' Rights, Early Childhood Education, Multi-cultural Relationship Building, GLBT Organizing, Predatory Lending, Organizing Block Clubs, Community Organizing Basics, Police and Community Relationships, Internalized Oppression, and Organizing for Public School Reform. Participants will leave energized, connected and inspired to lead in their communities. </Description>

      <Description>At ESCAROSA Greyhound Adoption (EGA), the main objective is adopting out retired race dogs from Pensacola, Florida and the Florida Panhandle. Through the help of many volunteers, they operate a successful greyhound adoption service. On average, they have 70-80 dogs available for adoption. They also keep some special need dogs, usually ones who have hurt their legs running and need only a small yard or to be walked on a leash.  Prior to adoption, all greyhounds are spayed/neutered and veterinarian checked. Prospective adopters bring their families and pets and meet the greyhounds available for adoption to find an appropriate match. </Description>

  <Description>BUILD HOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES.  Volunteers are needed to help Habitat for Humanity build homes for families in Sacramento County.  Tasks range from clean-up, painting, landscaping, framing, digging, and installing doors and windows - and other miscellaneous duties.  If you are the person who doesn't mind doing a variety of tasks with a cheerful attitude - WE WANT YOUR HELP!   


You do not need tools or construction experience to volunteer although any construction knowledge is welcome!   


The address shown on this project is not the construction site.  We dont receive the project location address until about 3 days before the project date.  All project locations are within the Sacramento County.  You will receive an email with the project location. 


Wear old clothes that you don't mind getting dirty.  SOCKS REQUIRED.  Water is on site but most volunteers bring water bottles.  Bring your own lunch and snacks. Safety orientation is conducted prior to work day - typical day is 7:30 AM to 4:00 PM (subject to change).  Be on time!

  <Title>Keeping Up Parks & Nature Areas</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.handsonsacto.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=555&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Sacramento is gifted with many parks and nature areas that provide us a refuge.  Parks are an integral part of the cultural identity of The City of Sacramento and remain one of the few places where families, residents, and visitors can go to relax, reflect, and recreate with no entrance fees or other costs.  

Keeping up our beautiful parks, trails, and nature areas is not possible without the help of dedicated volunteers like you.  Show that you care and be a responsible citizen of Sacramento by helping to preserve, protect, and beautify parks, facilities, natural areas, bike, pedestrian and equestrian trails for present and future generations. 

Between March and November, volunteers will have a chance to participate in tasks such as removing invasive plants and cleaning various parks, trails and nature areas managed by The City of Sacramento.

<b>Minimum Age: 5</b>

<b>Children under 18 are welcome.  However, they MUST be accompanied by adult volunteers at all time.  Youth volunteers also must submit a HOS Youth Waiver (see resource document below) prior to the project date.</b>  


Project Schedules:

September 2007
Volunteers will help remove invasive plants.

October 2007
Removing trash and invasive plants (star thistle) from a nature area.

March & June 2008
Volunteers will be taking out nonnative planes to promote the growth of native grasses. This is a wonderful opportunity to see some of the City of Sacramentos open spaces and see what a difference you can make in a shot amount of time.

  <Description><b>Volunteers must be 18 years of age or older in order to participate in this project.</b>

<b>If you will be using our volunteer opportunity for a community service project or will need documentation of your community service hours, you must complete an interview in person with the volunteer coordinator prior to the start of your term of service.</b>

Did you know there are over 30,000 people in the Sacramento area who are blind or have low vision?
Society for the Blind is the Sacramento Regions only full service agency serving blind and visually impaired people of all ages.

Be part of the excitement and help raise funds for Society for the Blind at the Sacramento Bingo Center!

All volunteers must contact the project leader after registering to volunteer.

  <Title>Children Uniting Nations  Annual Day of the Child 2008</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=938&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Purpose of the Event:  This event is designed to bring awareness and support the needs of the children who, by no fault of their own, are living in out of home care.  The Day of the Child is the communitys way of letting foster children know that someone cares by providing mentors for the day.

The Day of the Child involves countless hours and dedication from numerous volunteers and hundreds of mentors.

At the end of the event, children receive care packages including books, educational materials and toiletries, which are donated by My Stuff Bags ® and other generous organizations.  Community-based organizations participate by providing on-site information booths.</Description>

  <Description>The Muscular Dystrophy Association is hosting a fun event to raise money to help out people with neuromuscular disease. We have recruited prominent business people in the Silver Lake and Los Feliz areas to agree to be mock 'arrested' for one hour of their day. We will be picking them up at their place of business, putting them in handcuffs, and bringing them to Home Restaurant in Silver Lake where they will raise their $1600 'bail money' for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The event will take place between the hours of 11am - 3pm on Thursday, October 30th. We will feed them lunch and give incentives and prizes to those who raise their bail. As a volunteer, you would do one of the following: 

Drivers--need to have a clean driving record and strong knowledge of the layout of major streets in the community. Drivers will be responsible for picking up and returning jailbirds (business executives) to and from their place of work utilizing donated cars. Jailbirds will need to be picked up every hour on the hour. A complete list and map with directions will be provided to each driver prior to pick up. Some drivers will also be returning jailbirds to their place of business throughout the day. 

Arresting Officers--Arresting officers will be paired with a driver for the day. They will serve as the "runner" for the driver and be responsible for "arresting" the jailbirds at their place of business. Arresting officers should be outgoing, chatty and have a flair for drama . . . able to really ham it up when arresting the jailbird. 

Dispatch Officers--along with an MDA staff person, organize the "pick-up" and "take back" of the jailbirds with the drivers. Ideal Dispatch Officers are highly organized and flexible in stressful situations. 

Bondsmen--along with an MDA staff person, work the "checkout" table where jailbirds meet with the "judge" and turn in their bail prior to release. Bondsmen verify the legibility of the pledge slips, count cash and credit cards and hand out incentives to top jailbirds. 

Processors--Escort jailbirds to the "jail." Take Polaroid pictures (mug shots). Processors should be perky and fun-loving. 

Mailroom--Check for legibility and stuff pledges. Prepare pledges for mailing. Great for those who prefer "behind the scenes" jobs. 

Jailbird Host--Conduct orientation and training of jailbirds, answer questions, "gofers," clean tables, refill drinks, etc. Hosts should have the gift of gab . . . lots of talking all day. 

Central Booking--Check in jailbirds, hand out surveys and nametags. If your nickname is Friendly Fred, you'll be perfect for this job.</Description>

  <Title>Stone Canyon Creek Restoration</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=864&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The once mighty Stone Canyon Creek was a dominant feature of the UCLA campus. Over the years, as the campus expanded, the creek was forced underground and now only a small segment behind the Anderson School of Business remains. The vegetation that persists at the creek site is dominated by invasive vegetation, which is choking out the few remaining native plant species.
 
Santa Monica Baykeeper staff began restoring the site by removing three large invasive trees. Continuing work by volunteers includes removal of invasive vegetation and planting of appropriate native plant species. Restoration work will continue through the fall.

Meet on Saturday at 10:00 am at the intersection of Charles Young Drive & Westwood Plaza off of Sunset Blvd. Look for white Santa Monica Baykeeper signs. Event is from 10am-1pm. Parking on campus is $7</Description>

  <Description>Pasadena Heritage is pleased to announce our 17th annual Craftsman Weekend, which will take place October 17-19, 2008.  Craftsman Weekend is a three-day educational conference highlighting the American Arts and Crafts Movement and Pasadena as a center of that movement in the early 1900s.  Activities include bus and walking tours, a furniture and decorative arts exhibit and sale and a spectacular Craftsman House Tour.  Craftsman Weekend is our most extensive educational event, and it would not be possible without the contributions of our wonderful volunteers!

We are currently recruiting volunteers for this years event, and we would love to have your help.  Volunteers are welcome to work more than one event.  In appreciation, volunteers are able to attend the event or events they work as guests of Pasadena Heritage, and everyone will receive an exhibit pass to attend the furnishings and decorative arts exhibit at the Masonic Temple.

There will be many different events throughout the day and some evenings during the three day conference. Volunteer opportunities will generally run in 3 hour shifts.</Description>

It's a beautiful 45 acre area that thousands of elementary aged school children visit every year to attend <strong>Eco-Tours</strong>, TreePeople's unique environmental educational program.  Once a month, on the 2nd Sat, we're gonna help them keep the park looking great by maintaining the trails, invasive plant removal, rock replacement, slope regrading, erosion protection, wall restoration (the walls were built in 1930's) and seedling cage/nursery work. Each month there will likely be a different task so join us in this exciting ongoing opportunity with one of our longest running agency partners. <p><strong>Click here to see:</strong>

  <Description>The seniors of Culver Village Retirement/Assisted Living want you! The elderly citizens of this charming seniors' home love to receive visitors, but don't often get them. Here's your chance to make a difference and develop a rewarding relationship with someone who will deeply value your company. On the second Saturday of every month, we have a party at the Village, where you have the opportunity to meet and talk with a number of the residents. It is a lot of fun, and hopefully you'll make a new pal whom you'll want to visit on a regular basis. Please join us and see what a little friendship can do for a life... yours and someone else's! Culver Village Retirement Assisted Living houses 110 seniors. They provide health services, exercise programs, social activities and a community gardening program for their residents.

Come see some of the world's great acrobats -- the loudest land mammals that Mother Nature ever created.

The Gibbon Conservation Center is located in Santa Clarita on 5 acres of land and houses one of the largest groups of gibbons (small apes) outside their countries of origin. All of the gibbons are housed outdoors in semi naturalistic enclosures. For fire reasons it is important that brush be cleared within 100 feet of each of the 17 enclosures. Trees need to be trimmed, and garden furniture and structures need to be painted. Dirt needs to be moved to new locations on the property.

The Gibbon Conservation Center was established to ensure the preservation, propagation and survival of all gibbons in the wild and in captivity. Most of the gibbons at the Center are on the highly endangered list.

Volunteers for this project will also be given a tour of the facility.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 13 years of age.

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.  The volunteer's parent or guardian must sign it.  <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/minor_release_laworks.pdf" target="_new">Click here to download our Volunteer Agreement & Release for Minor Child.</a> Bring the completed form with you to the project.

  <Description>The Aviva Center cares for abused, neglected and emotionally disturbed adolescents in a variety of treatment programs. At each two-hour session of this project we lift their spirits by providing three different activities for the girls to participate in.

Two of these are arts & craft projects, the third is a sports-related activity.  Volunteers will be able to select which activity they wish to participate in and supervise.  Two hours of your time on a Saturday will brighten the entire week for these kids.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 21 years of age.

  <Description>The Ballona Wetlands Land Trust is a non-profit community organization dedicated to the acquisition, restoration and preservation of one of the last remaining wetlands ecosystems in Southern California. On the second Saturday of each month from 10AM to 2PM, volunteers are needed to help remove non-native plants and trash, and they are then invited to go on guided eco-tours offered by local biologists and ecologists. Refreshments and free raffle prizes are also available. 

Please bring Work Gloves if you have them -- they are mandatory for weeding and trash clean-up and we only have a limited supply! 

Also, we recommend sunscreen, sunglasses, sunhat and a water bottle.  Wear workboots or sturdy footware and clothes that can get dirty.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 5 years of age. Pre-teens must be accompanied by a parent.

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.  The volunteer's parent or guardian must sign it.  <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/minor_release_laworks.pdf" target="_new">Click here to download our Volunteer Agreement & Release for Minor Child.</a> Bring the completed form with you to the project.

Federal Law prohibits volunteers under the age of 13 from registering on-line.  To register family members who are under the age of 13, contact the project leader directly.

  <Title>Lift Teen Hearts and Spirits (Angel's Flight)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=17&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>SPONSORED BY: MARMOL RADZINER AND ASSOCIATES AIA

NOTE: SPECIAL HOLIDAY PROGRAMMING
Oct. 15 - Pumpkin Carving Night. Volunteers must be willing to bring a pumpkin for this occurrence.
Nov. 19 - Thanksgiving Dinner Potluck. Volunteers must be willing to bring a contribution to the potluck.

Angel's Flight is a temporary shelter for runaway and at-risk teens located in the MacArthur park area. They have an extensive program that includes counseling, life skills training, drug prevention education and classes.
 
Twice a month, L.A. Works Volunteers visit Angel's Flight and engage their teens in activities that bring fun, creative energy and positive role models to their lives. Our Project Leaders organize activities for volunteers to engage and uplift their spirit.  On any given evening this may be an arts & crafts activity, a dance contest, games like Pictionary or charades, or a fun discussion.  
 
Our goal is to warm their hearts by exposing them to bright, upbeat, motivated people who are willing to share an evening with them.  We want to provide the opportunity for them to creatively express themselves, and have fun in the process.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 18 years of age.

  <Description>Do you like color painting, cutting and pasting pictures, drawing, playing games, chatting, having fun, and at the same time brighten up people's smiles? Then, you'll love the arts and crafts projects at Alhambra Convalescent Home. The Alhambra Convalescent Home is a 97-bed facility that provides healthcare to individuals with special needs. Very few of them can walk on their own - many have had strokes. Some people do their own art projects themselves, some with minimal assistance - others really can't do it themselves, so the volunteers do the pictures or projects for them - sitting there with them & talking with them as they work - and the end result is that the resident gets a picture "made just for them." Many of these residents don't have regular visitors - and they are just happy to have people come in and say hello, spend a little time with them doing art, or sometimes you may just sit there and hold someone's hand. The people here are very friendly, and your visit makes a crucial difference in the quality of their life.

  <Title>Senior Interaction (Alexandria Care Center)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=21&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>SPECIAL PROGRAMMING NOTE: SEPTEMBER 27TH
Have you ever wondered, where will you end up in your old age? Wherever you end up, i pray that you have company and well wishers around. As part of LA Works event at Alexandria Senior Care Center, we take on the role of well wishers for many of these seniors. Most of these seniors don't have any family or friends visiting them. As you might be aware typically we take these seniors out to a nearby store. Often this is the only time they get to go out in the whole month.

We felt that the Seniors needed a bigger and better outing, so we are organizing a trip to Griffith Park observatory on September 27th. You are invited to join us by signing up on LA Works website. In addition we are fund raising to pay for 3 specially equipped handicap vans that will be taking them. Please join us in making this event a possibility by making a secure donation on the following page using your credit card:
< http://www.firstgiving.com/senior_outing >
Thanks,
Crystal and Saurabh (project leaders)


Come join us as we provide support and companionship for the clients of Alexandria Care Center. We usually take them for a neighborhood walk, which includes a shopping excursion in the surrounding area. Volunteers will be pushing seniors in their wheelchairs approximately four blocks to nearby stores. 

If the weather isn't suitable for an outing, we will visit with them in the facility and lead them in some sort of activity (bingo? Sing-a-longs? Stories? Or just chatting with them about their lives.)  Our company and companionship means a lot to these folks!

Alexandria Care Center is a skilled nursing facility that provides short-term rehabilitation necessary to get their senior clients back home. The center also provides long term care for patients that need 24-hour attention. Bilingual (Spanish & English) volunteers are especially needed (though not necessary).</Description>

  <Title>Environmental Education Garden (Daniel Webster)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=26&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Many of you may have grown up in a world full of trees, open fields, and public parksor even just a backyardwhere you had the opportunity to view nature at work. Children these days aren't so privileged, especially in Los Angeles. The Daniel Webster Garden was established to teach children growing up in an urban area about the environment. Join us as we create new plots, remove weeds and brush, and add new plants. The Belmar Child and Family Center run the Daniel Webster Education Garden. The Center is a child guidance clinic that provides, among other forms of therapy, horticulture therapy. The Center and Daniel Webster Middle School share the Garden.

WHAT DO VOLUNTEERS DO IN THE GARDEN?
The work is seasonal and deals with the care and maintenance of various areas of the one acre garden.  Weeding is always needed, more so in the growing season.  Care of vegetable beds might be done, if that is your interest.  There are 10 flowering areas: 2 rose areas, 5 tropical areas-2 with small ponds, 2 mixed flower beds, 1 cactus/succulent area, 2 lawn areas and a small orchard.

No garden experience is necessary as most tasks can be taught at the event.

We have all the tools necessary unless you prefer your own hand tools.  We have gloves, knee cushions, clippers, hoes, shovels, pick axe, rakes, hand tools etc.  We have a cool propagation room where you might work with potted plants.  You might dig up and plant new garden vegetable beds or harvest form existing beds.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 5 years of age.  Pre-teens must be accompanied by a parent.

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.  The volunteer's parent or guardian must sign it.  <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/minor_release_laworks.pdf" target="_new">Click here to download our Volunteer Agreement & Release for Minor Child.</a> Bring the completed form with you to the project.

Federal Law prohibits volunteers under the age of 13 from registering on-line.  To register family members who are under the age of 13, contact the project leader directly.

  <Title>Activities with Teens (Children of the Night)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=332&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Children of the Night is a private, non-profit organization founded in 1979, dedicated to assisting children between the ages of 11 and 17 who are forced to prostitute on the streets for food and a place to sleep. Residents follow a highly structured program that includes attending an on-site school where they study a curriculum individually tailored to their specific needs so they can reach age- appropriate grade levels in all subjects before leaving. 
 
With the help of caseworkers, each youngster formulates a "life plan" and attends independent living classes, as well as participating in sports and recreational activities plus evening workshops in crafts, yoga, 12-step meetings, poetry, AIDS education, and more. 

LA Works has the exciting opportunity to lead fun and enriching evening workshops for 12-15 of these teens.  The Project Leader will have a planned activity for each session, and volunteers are needed to help facilitate.  Please come join us in this unique volunteer opportunity! 

Volunteers must be at least 18 years of age.

Each L.A. Works project is organized and managed by a trained volunteer Project Leader. L.A.

By attending this short training, you'll learn how easy it is to lead an L.A. Works Project!

  <Title>Activities with Kids (Midnight Mission)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=7&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description><IMG src="http://admin.laworks.com/uploaded_files/deliverFile.php/kennerly_btc_6.jpg"width="240" height="157" align="right">The children at this family housing shelter would love to play games or draw with you while their parents build a better future by working and participating in group counseling sessions. The Midnight Mission Family Housing program attempts to break the cycle of homelessness for families by combining transitional housing with a supportive environment.

Each Tuesday night, from 615pm-815pm, LA Works entertains the 12-15 children (ages 3-12) at this facility in Inglewood with art projects, games, tutoring, etc. while the parents attend a counseling session. It's a fun and enjoyable evening - the kids really appreciate the volunteers.  We normally will play outside (ball, jump rope, swings,  tag, etc) and then do some craft project and/or games as time permits. 

Volunteers for this project must be at least 5 years of age. Pre-teens must be accompanied by a parent.

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.  The volunteer's parent or guardian must sign it.  <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/minor_release_laworks.pdf" target="_new">Click here to download our Volunteer Agreement & Release for Minor Child.</a> Bring the completed form with you to the project.

Federal Law prohibits volunteers under the age of 13 from registering on-line.  To register family members who are under the age of 13, contact the project leader directly or create a "family team" using the website's team creation facility.

  <Description><IMG src="http://admin.laworks.com/uploaded_files/deliverFile.php/the%20cast.jpg"width="250" height="187" align="right">Check out the teens at L.A. Family Housing's Sydney M. Irmas Transitional Living Center.  The Center is the only facility in the Valley that accepts and provides longterm shelter to teens and their families. 

They have an extensive program that includes counseling, life skills training, drug prevention education and classes.

Twice a month L.A. Works will visit the facility with their volunteers to engage the teens in uplifting activities such as dances, arts and crafts, or a fun conversation. Our goal is to inspire them to explore their creative outlets while providing positive role models for them. Our Project leaders will be in charge of creating and organizing these activities. As volunteers, you'll be briefed and assist in carrying out the night's activity.  If any advance preparation is needed on your part, you'll be emailed with specific project details.

Our goal for the evening is to have a fun time and to encourage them to express themselves artistically. All upbeat and outgoing volunteers are welcome to sign up, but all volunteers must be at least 18 years of age.

  <Description>Once each month we help out at Alexandria House with whatever they need to "spruce up" their facility.  This can range from gardening, to organizing the garage, cleaning the kitchen, sorting food and clothing, to preparing activities for neighborhood events.  It's always a fun afternoon.  Call the Project Leader to find out what's in store this month!

Alexandria House founded in 1996 is a house of hospitality providing safe and supportive housing for women and children in the process of moving from emergency shelter to permanent housing.  Alexandria House also serves as a neighborhood center, providing educational, cultural and enrichment opportunities for residents and neighbors alike.

  <Description>The seniors of Hallmark Cheviot Hills Assisted Living (formerly Wilshire Retirement Center) want you! The elderly citizens of this charming seniors' home love to receive visitors, but don't often get them. Here's your chance to make a difference and develop a rewarding relationship with someone who will deeply value your company. On the third Saturday of every month, we have a party at Wilshire Retirement Center, where you have the opportunity to meet and talk with a number of the residents. It is a lot of fun, and hopefully you'll make a new pal whom you'll want to visit on a regular basis. Please join us and see what a little friendship can do for a life... yours and someone else's!

  <Title>Franklin Canyon Park Transformation</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=646&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description><strong>Come help L.A. Works give Franklin Canyon Park a Makeover!</strong>

<img src="http://info.laworks.com/images/LAWD2007/LAWD2007FC.jpg"

L.A. Works is expanding and solidifying our partnership with the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) by providing much needed volunteer help monthly to several parks in their jurisdiction.  We want to begin with Franklin Canyon Park. There is a great amount of work to be done at this site and we feel it will be the beginning of an important relationship with MRCA

You will be participating in a major upgrade in this park and every month the tasks will vary. Tasks will include but not be limited to:

Maintaining the trails; 
Invasive plant removal; 
Rock replacement; 
Slope regrading; 
Erosion protection; 
Planting native plants; 
Painting benches; etc... 

This will be an ongoing effort, tackling different areas in this huge park at different times.  We will also be assisting the park to become more disabled accessible by widening trails and removing steps in certain areas to improve accessibility .

Please wear clothes that you don't mind getting dirty and remember to protect yourself from the sun and bring water!  Also, if you have a shovel or a steel rake you could bring from home it would be much appreciated!

<strong> <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/FranklinCanyon_rev.pdf">Please download the detailed map to Franklin Canyon Park to help you find the project!</a></strong>
 
Volunteers for this project must be at least 13 years of age. 

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.  The volunteer's parent or guardian must sign it.  <a href="http://info.laworks.com/pdfs/minor_release_laworks.pdf" target="_new">Click here to download our Volunteer Agreement & Release for Minor Child.</a> Bring the completed form with you to the project.

      <Description>The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is the only agency to provide our community with free comprehensive homeless information for the entire region of San Diego County.  RTFH information is used to address our communitys need for homeless funding, planning, coordination and advocacy.  The RTFH addresses our communitys needs for homeless funding by providing information for the annual HUD Supportive Housing Program application.  This application, which is developed through a collaboration of homeless service providers and public entities, brings in 8-12 million dollars of Federal homeless funds to our region.  Local homeless services providers use RTFH information on homeless in numerous other State and Federal grant applications.  

The RTFH addresses our communitys need for homeless planning, coordination and advocacy by providing information & referral services to the region along with reports on homeless services, funding and population information.  The RTFH also provides a HUD mandated Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) to our local continuum of care.  This system provides many agencies a cost effective way of collecting and reporting on homeless data.  This in turn allows agency staff more time to spend with their homeless clients.

The RTFH, being a small nonprofit organization needs volunteer assistance for its multiple homeless projects.  These projects lead to the collection of homeless data that is eventually provided to the community in report form.  Homeless people are the ones who in the end benefit from all the work the RTFH does.</Description>

(example- Guests looking for the restroom, cell phone use during the concert, etc..)  Each concert lasts approximately one hour.  Please arrive by 9:30 so that we have time to prepare before children arrive, and wear white shirts and dark pants/skirts if possible. The Horton Plaza garage does validate for free for up to 3 hours.

  <Description>San Diego River Assessment and field data collection.
Mission Valley Saturday October 26th 9-12:30 and 12:30-4
Volunteers will go out in teams to survey invasive plants, trash, and homeless camps along the river.  This time we will focus on the length of the river in Mission Valley. We will divide portions of the river into segments that can be surveyed within 2 to 3 hours. Volunteers can sign up for one or more segment(s)during the Blitz. Each segment will have a team of 4 - 6 people assisgned to it including a trained team leader.

No experience necessary, and there are many levels of involvement available. 
This is perfect for biology and science enthusiasts and a great way to meet other people interested in the environment. Also a great way to see sections of the San Diego River not often visited.</Description>

We provide the gloves, bags, hand sanitizer and other essentials for cleaning up trash. 

All volunteers are welcome to participate and must sign a liability waiver, but volunteers under 18 MUST have a parent or guardian present at the beginning of the cleanup to sign a liability waiver before the minor can participate or they can bring a signed waiver to the cleanup (download one at http://surfridersd.org/beachcleanups.php).

      <Name>San Elijo Lagoon Conservacy</Name>
      <Description>The San Elijo Lagoon Conservacy was founded in 1987 to protect, preserve and enhance the San Elijo Lagoon and its watershed. Californias coastal wetlands traditionally provided water quality, flood and erosion control, habitat for plants and animals, and recreational opportunities. However, 95% of all wetlands are lost forever to urbanization and development. Covering 1,000 acres between Solana Beach, Encinitas, and Rancho Santa Fe, the San Elijo Lagoon is home to more than 700 species of spectacularly beautiful plants and animals, many of which are critically endangered. Visitors enjoy 7.5 miles of hiking and jogging trails leading though six different plant communities. The conservancy works to maintain and improve the health of the lagoon though habitat restoration programs, scientific monitoring, and environmental education. Volunteers assist in a variety of ways: 1) trail maintenance, exotic plants removal, native shrub plantings, etc,; 2) staffing community fair and other special event booths/ tables; 3)leading guided nature walks for school groups and visitors (intensive docent training provided). </Description>

      <Description>The Women's Shelter Program is committed to recognizing and responding to our community's need for comprehensive multicultural domestic violence services. We understand that domestic violence, in its fullest scope, impacts primary victims, family members, society, and future generations. With this in mind, it is our goal to stop the cycle of violence by providing crisis intervention, emergency shelter, advocacy, treatment, prevention and education. 

Women's Shelter Program Vision 

"A society where intimate partners and family members treat each other with dignity, respect, and compassion; where oppression is replaced with equality; where the expression of conflict and anger is non-violent; where children grow up with their esteem intact and are nurtured in such a manner they recognize the value of speaking the truth, welcoming diversity and practicing cooperation. Our vision is a society free from intimate and political wars."

      <Name>Therapeutic Equestrian Activity Center for the Handicapped</Name>
      <Description>Nestled in a quiet corner of Lakeside is a wonderful program for handicapped children. Called T.E.A.C.H. (Therapeutic Equestrian Activity Center for the Handicapped), the program is designed for children young and old with specific needs. Instead of simply using traditional exercise methods, this unique class makes use of horses to help develop motor skills.

And teaching is what its all about. The program is headed by Mrs. Cleo Williams, who is always full of energy and willing to give it her all to help the students. Love and devotion is evident in her methods, and its easy to see the progress her pupils make as the months go by. Lessons consist of basic riding instruction, but they dont end there. Students learn to coordinate their minds and their bodies through exercises designed to sharpen their motor skills. Rings, toys, and other objects are incorporated in the lessons to not only make learning fun, but to stimulate activity in the brain as well.

Those who wish to lend a helping hand are always welcome, as the classes depend on the selfless volunteers that donate their time. T.E.A.C.H. is a great program that welcomes students of all ages, and to see such progress from them is nothing short of astounding.</Description>

has been delivering nutritious meals to men, women, and children living with AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. For over twelve years our home deliveries have been an essential ingredient to maintaining the good health of our clients.  While recent advances in AIDS drug therapy have dramatically improved the lives of a many AIDS patients, not all have responded positively and many more suffer from debilitating side effects.  Rising rents in San Diego present another challenge, and recently we are finding that more of our clients are living in hotels with limited or no kitchen facilities.

      <Description>Special Delivery San Diego  
has been delivering nutritious meals to men, women, and children living with AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. For over twelve years our home deliveries have been an essential ingredient to maintaining the good health of our clients.  While recent advances in AIDS drug therapy have dramatically improved the lives of a many AIDS patients, not all have responded positively and many more suffer from debilitating side effects.  Rising rents in San Diego present another challenge, and recently we are finding that more of our clients are living in hotels with limited or no kitchen facilities.

We need between 25-50 volunteers to conduct a short telephone survey to SDG&E customers.  SDG&E is one of 2-1-1 San Diegos partners and they would like to conduct a survey with 1,100 of their medical baseline customers in back country areas that could be affected by SDG&Es power shut-off program.  They want to be prepared for neighborhood power outages and disaster related issues by utilizing 2-1-1 as a place for San Diegans to get updated information; as well, 2-1-1 can voice caller concerns to SDG&E.  These are not telemarketing or sales calls!  This is our opportunity to advocate for our clients.

-  Must have Excel and Internet access (you will need to plug the 211 phone into your modem while using your internet at the same time  there should be a hub or switch connected to your modem allowing you to do this)
- There will be no long distance charges as you will be using 211s phone

-You are not required to leave a message, you will need to call back later.

  <Title>WITH SENIORS at Salem Lutheran Home</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.handsonbayarea.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=73923&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Volunteers will support the seniors gardening group hosted by Salem's horticulture specialist. First we'll read a newspaper article or a book excerpt related to the topic of the day.  Then help these lovely seniors with some "light" gardening like potting, pruning or watering or help  make sachets or bookmarks using petals and/or fragrant herbs. 

No gardening experience necessary! In fact, you will learn horticulture tips to get you started with a flower pot of your own at home. Weather permitting, the activity will take place outside on the beautiful patio. Bring your smile and good vibe to encourage these seniors who value your time and company!
Ages 16 to adult.   (East Bay: Oakland)</Description>

  <Description>The Boys Hope program houses seven very deserving teenage scholars. They are in need of an extra push and motivation in the academic arena; each scholar has his own area of needed attention, i.e., English vocabulary and grammar, foreign language, mathematics, etc. As a Hands On Bay Area volunteer, you will provide one-on-one academic guidance to one of the scholars during each session of this weekly project. Comfort with High School level material is appreciated, but not required- Tutors will be matched with boys whose needs best fit their ability. (Noe Valley)</Description>

      <Description>Founded in 1977 by Father Paul Sheridan, Boys Hope Girls Hope is a privately funded, non-profit, multi-denominational organization that helps academically capable and motivated children-in-need to meet their full potential by providing value-centered, family-like homes, opportunities and education through college. Scholars who are accepted and placed into the program voluntarily, and with guardian consent, leave a home environment that may be marked by drug abuse, poverty, neglect, or even from caring families unable to meet the childs needs.  Each scholar has the option of returning to their original home on weekends. Theres no place like HOPE  Home, Opportunities, Parents, and Education.  Boys Hope Girls Hope

<b> Septembers Book:</b>
<u> When Broken Glass Floats: Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge </u>
by Chanrithy Him
In this story, Him recounts her childhood in Cambodia, land of the infamous killing fields. She and her siblings try to stay strong and loyal to the family even through living in brutal labor camps. Unflinchingly honest, Him does not shy away from describing even the most horrific of details, yet the story never delves into complete despair: throughout the memoir, Him maintains a sense of hope that is both inspirational and beautiful.

<b> Octobers Book:</b>
<u> The Post-American World</u> 
by Fareed Zakaria. 
Zakaria's book is about the "rise of the rest," a catchy phrase from one of the most widely cited writers on foreign affairs. His prism is correct: We should focus more on the "rest," even if America is still the premier superpower. But within this broad approach, Zakaria leaves policy-makers to figure out how to rank challenges and restore U.S. legitimacy. 

<b> Novembers Book:</b>
<u> The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot </u> 
by Naomi Wolf
Wolf warns that the willful collective denial of what the United States government, especially the executive branch, has been doing in the name of national security and the protection of America's freedoms must end or our democracy as we know it shall end. This book is "a citizen's call to action" outlining how easily a country can slide into a dictatorship by the erosion of individual rights, citing examples of Mussolini's rise to power, the advent and usurpation of Germany's democracy by the Third Reich, and Stalin's ruthless consolidation and centralization of power in Russia. Wolf breathes a terrible life into a monster most people in America do not know exists, although many see it and refuse to acknowledge it.

  <Description>This program pairs volunteers up with children to assist them with homework. If homework is not available, volunteers will engage the youth in reading sessions and journal writing.  Harbor House is a Salvation Army transitional housing program for single parent families in recovery.  Returning volunteers are urged to commit to every other week for a full semester.

To ensure the security of the children Harbor House will now be performing background checks on all returning volunteers. Volunteers who have not already done so are asked to come fifteen minutes earlier to fill out paperwork(SF: SOMA)

      <Description>The Zoological Society of Florida (ZSF) is the non-profit support organization for Miami Metrozoo. ZSF was founded in 1956, when the Zoo was located in Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. Starting in the mid-Sixties, Zoo members spearheaded a campaign to include plans for a bigger, better zoo on the Dade County Decade of Progress bond issue. Voters approved the bond in 1972, and nine years later Miami Metrozoo opened its gates to the public at its current location. Today the zoo is 740 total acres and has 81 exhibits.

      <Name>Virginia Key Beach Park (City of Miami)</Name>
      <Description>Located on Key Biscayne off the Rickenbacker Causeway lies an 82-acre barrier island called Virginia Key. While the property belongs to the City of Miami and is maintained by City of Miami Parks and Recreation Department, the responsibility is shared in part with the Virginia Key Beach Trust who manage a portion of the beach front and oversee the preservation and future development of Virginia Key Beach.

Additionally the Parks and Recreation Department is currently involved in the restoration and preservation of the 15 acre Hammock area located on Virginia Key. This has involved the removal of invasive exotic vegetation and restoring native plants to the area. During this process many important botanical species have been discovered including some that are classified as threatened or endangered such as Zanthoxylum coriaceum (Biscayne Prickly Ash), Coccothrinax argentata (Florida Silver Palm) and Scaevola plumieri (Beachberry).

  <Description>A Passion For Paws is running out of room for rescued dogs, so we are building kennels which will help us save more lives. It is a labor intensive project. It involves leveling soil, concrete work, putting up fences, applying shade cloths and picking up delivered material at Home Depot. 
Because A Passion For Paws is a charity for homeless dogs, the hours can be used for community service. 

Great project for an indivdual or group. Location: Escondido.
Minimum age 18, 16 with adult.

      <Name>Rady Children's Hospital</Name>
      <Description>Rady Childrens is San Diego regions only designated pediatric trauma center and the only area hospital dedicated solely to pediatric care. Our goal is to help create a region where all children go to school healthy and ready to learn how to be productive, responsible citizens. Todays children are tomorrows leaders.

Quality pediatric care requires specialized training and a special sensitivity that is perfected through caring for children 100 percent of the time. From mild illness and injury to the most severe medical emergency, Rady Childrens specially qualified clinical staff and affiliated physicians provide a full continuum of care.

From birth through adolescence, children have special health care needs that are different from those of adults. Their bodies respond differently to injury and illness. And most children do not understand  or know how to deal with  the experience of serious illness or hospitalization. Rady Childrens responds to those needs by providing expert pediatric care within a unique healing environment.</Description>

  <Description>The San Diego Healing Arts Festival (SD HAF) began in 2004 as a student council event for the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine. Former talent agent and acupuncture student, Ryan Altman, had a vision of bringing together music with healing arts in a way that made both accessible to the public. Some would come for the healing aspect and be turned on to the music and others would come for the music and be exposed to healthier lifestyle choices.  We are looking for several volunteer positions to fill.

EVENT START TIME  11 AM
EVENT END TIME  4 PM

AM shift is 9:30 AM - 2 PM

      <Description>501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to promoting the use of integrative healing arts and to improve access to care for underserved communities.  We coordinate a series of Integrative Health Nights in City Heights and Southeastern San Diego bringing Eastern and Western health modalities together.  During the October wildfires, we were out at Qualcomm Stadium, Gillespie Field, and Ramona coordinating over 30 practitioners per day providing free acupuncture and massage for evacuees, firefighters and emergency staff alike.

We also produce a series of health related events that incorporate music into healing.  Our Alternative Happy Hour series at the World Beat Center and our annual San Diego Healing Arts Festival are extremely popular and have gained us community, sponsor and media attention alike.  Now in its 4th year, the San Diego Healing Arts Festival is a free music and health event on the first Sunday each May in Balboa Park.  We host a field of exhibitors, demonstrations, performances, and workshops on massage, acupuncture, dance, nutrition, and more.  In 2008 were expecting over 15,000 attendees and are proud to welcome Pato Banton & the Mystic Roots Band, B-Side Players, Al Howard, Molly Jenson, Justin James, and Sene Africa to our main stage.</Description>

      <Description>Our mission is to provide a safe haven to rescued cats and to educate the public about the growing population of abandoned and unwanted exotic animals and where they come from. Our primary concerns are for the health and comfort of our cats and the safety of those who share these precious natural resources. We protect and provide these animals with a lifetime home realizing that environment, exercise, and personal attention are key to their well being. Every attempt is made to provide healthy diets, medical care, immunizations, and whatever else is necessary for the physical and psychological welfare of each animal in our care. In addition to our current family of cats, others in need of medical aid and rest are welcome to this facility, limited only by the extent to which we are able to provide adequate help, shelter, and safety. Our principal obligation is to our rescued cats, but we are concerned with the welfare of all captive big cats.</Description>

Location: North County Inland - San Diego 92129

Our garden is growing! The Rancho Penasquitos Branch Library has two large indoor atriums. Both library visitors and staff enjoy looking at the beautiful greenery. The plants contribute to the librarys welcoming ambience plus help keep the air clean, thus contributing to a healthier environment. The library needs volunteers to spruce up the atriums by adding soil, trimming, planting, removing dead leaves, etc. 
as an added bonus, we will provide refreshments.

Supplies needed: Volunteers should bring their own gardening gloves. Donations of indoor plants and soil/bark would be greatly appreciated, as well as any garden ornaments, but this is not a requirement for volunteering.

Minimum age: 6 with an adult, 13 without an adult.

Volunteers needed: at least two, but whatever it takes to get the job done!</Description>

  <Description>The San Diego County Chapter of the Surfrider Foundation and San Diego Coastkeeper, coordinate cleanups two times a month. On the second Saturday, we cleanup a North County San Diego beach (Oceanside to Torrey Pines), and on the fourth Saturday of every month we cleanup a beach in South County San Diego (La Jolla to Imperial Beach). To help out, all you have to do is show up. For all beach cleanups, please wear comfortable clothes, closed-toe shoes and sunscreen. We provide the gloves, bags, hand sanitizer and other essentials for cleaning up trash. 

All volunteers are welcome to participate and must sign a liability waiver, but volunteers under 18 MUST have a parent or guardian present at the beginning of the cleanup to sign a liability waiver before the minor can participate or they can bring a signed waiver to the cleanup (download one at http://surfridersd.org/beachcleanups.php). 

Check http://surfridersd.org/beachcleanups.php for the complete cleanup schedule.

Great for individuals or groups (maximum group size 50). </Description>

  <Description>Join Boston Cares for Octobers Conversation Café: Left Behind: Education and Populations at Risk. As college tuition prices continue to rise, many students are facing the prospect of not being able to afford to attend institutions of higher education.  

Boston Cares is happy to invite representatives from Year Up and TERI College Planning to discuss the services their organizations provide students.     

Year Up is a program that strives to close the opportunity divide in education by providing urban young adults with the skills, experience, and support that will empower them to reach their potential through professional careers and higher education. 

TERI College Planning promotes educational opportunities for all people of all ages and backgrounds. We pursue this goal through the administration and guarantee of loan programs for students at all education levels, and through our management of college access programs targeting underserved individuals, who are often the first generation in their families to go to college.

This is a great opportunity to learn more about these organizations and the services they provide, as well what is being done to help those being left behind by the current education system. 

_______________________________________
This program is offered in conjunction with several service projects. Make the shift into civic engagement by using what youve learned by volunteering at a project that is related to education. The Work Place is a non-profit center dedicated to fostering economic growth in the City of Boston by developing high quality workforce development services for two sets of customers: job seekers and employers.

  <Title>Usher at the Huntington Theatre: Carrie Fisher's "Wishful Drinking"</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=1985&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Huntington Theatre Company, a non-profit organization in residence at Boston University, has been Bostons leading professional theatre company for a quarter-century.

Volunteers are needed to usher the show and also stuff and distribute programs, and do a light cleaning after the performance.

<b>About the show:</b>  Dont miss Hollywood legend Carrie Fishers recounting of a true and intoxicating tale, told with the same wry wit she poured into bestsellers like Postcards from the Edge. Born to celebrity parents Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, this Tinseltown toddler lands among the stars when shes cast in a little movie called Star Wars. But it isnt all sweetness and light sabers: as a single mom, she also battles addiction, depression, mental institutions, and that awful hyperspace hairdo. Fishers tale is a tabloid vivant The Los Angeles Times calls a Beverly Hills yard sale of juicy anecdotes. Carrie Fishers Wishful Drinking is an uproarious look at a Hollywood hangover and a chance to get Carried away!

Volunteers must wear black bottoms and white tops. Be prepared for downtime before the show (bring a book if necessary) because you will not know if there are programs to stuff until you arrive.

T-Accessible, Green Line (Symphony).

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

      <Name>Big Sister Association Of Greater Boston</Name>
      <Description>DESCRIPTION
The Big Sister Association was founded in 1951 by three Cambridge residents who believed that girls in their community could benefit from the guidance and support of an older female friend. Originally providing six girls with mentors, today the Big Sister Association serves more than 1,800 girls annually through various mentoring programs. 

Currently, they offer three types of programs for young girls, Community-Based Mentoring, School-Based Mentoring and Group Mentoring. 

More than half of the girls Big Sister serves annually participate in Community-Based Mentoring programs.  These one-on-one mentoring opportunities match girls (Little Sisters) with caring and committed women volunteers (Big Sisters), who meet during days and times of their own choosing and at various locations throughout the greater community. 

Big Sisters newest program, School-Based Mentoring, is specifically designed for girls in elementary schools (approximately ages 7-11). Launched in 2001, School-Based Mentoring incorporates aspects of Big Sisters Community-Based Mentoring program, by individually matching girls with women volunteers, as well as aspects of our site-based models, by bringing adult mentors into girls educational environments. 

Big Sister offers two group mentoring programs for middle school girls (ages 12 to 15): Life Choices and TEAM (Team Enhanced Approach to Mentoring). As site-based programsLife Choices and TEAM groups are hosted by schools and neighborhood centers throughout Greater Bostonthese mentoring models create a safe space where girls can explore the many different choices and challenges they face in life. More than merely a place free of physical violence, these safe spaces create an atmosphere of intimacy and mutual respect where girls feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions with adults and 
with each other.

IMPACT
In 2002, Big Sister served 1,860 girls, a 44 percent increase over the number of girls served in 2000.

  9:00 to noon  50+ volunteers needed to welcome and greet, final registration, close down registration, hand out T-shirts, assist with program and help with event tear-down

Why You Need to Get Involved 
One in ten of our neighbors dont know where their next meal is coming from and are not readily identified.  Those without enough to eat, or without the resources to do something about it, have been our neighbors for a long time. Those who are hungry are not readily identified.  They are grandparents, they are fellow students, they are families facing foreclosure or a job lay-off.  Organizations that provide emergency food witness the escalating need and the critical issues around hunger every day. 
 
The demand upon emergency food programs has been increasing dramatically over the past several years.  There were nearly 1,000,000 visits to Twin Cities metro area food shelves in 2007, and over 1,000,000 meals served to those in need. And this year, food shelf usage in the metro area has risen 14% (to date) over the same period last year.
Hunger is intolerable, solvable, and must be addressed!
Become part of the solution!   

Sign up to volunteer on our web site  www.walktoendhunger.org  or call 612-807-2228.


The Walk to End Hunger is presented by the Twin Cities Hunger Initiative - Catholic Charities, 
Emergency Foodshelf Network, Greater Twin Cities United Way , Hope For The City, 
Hunger Solutions, Keystone Community Services, Loaves and Fishes, Neighborhood House, 
Neighbors, Inc. and Second Harvest Heartland.

  <Description>The Minnehaha Creek Watershed District has partnered with Tree Trust to provide residents in their area with low-cost trees. Before these trees can get in the ground and get to work improving the environmental health of their community, they need to be distributed to the people who purchased them.

You can help us hand out approximately 300 trees on Saturday, September 27 at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum in Chaska. Volunteers will load trees and bags of mulch into vehicles, direct traffic, and verify order information from 8:00 am to 12:30 pm or 12:30 pm to 5:00 pm. </Description>

  <Description>Pilot Knob Hill, a national historic site overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, has played a significant role in our region's cultural and natural history. This fall, volunteers of all ages are invited to continue the work of restoring this majestic site to its original beauty. Past work has included the removal of invasive buckthorn, Seeding, and a professional prescribed burn. This year, volunteers will spread native seeds along the bluff slopes and blue top. Pilot Knob is a gorgeous site and important for wildlife species. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to help preserve it for future generations. </Description>

  <Title>Keeping Up Parks & Nature Areas</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.handsonsacto.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=555&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Sacramento is gifted with many parks and nature areas that provide us a refuge.  Parks are an integral part of the cultural identity of The City of Sacramento and remain one of the few places where families, residents, and visitors can go to relax, reflect, and recreate with no entrance fees or other costs.  

Keeping up our beautiful parks, trails, and nature areas is not possible without the help of dedicated volunteers like you.  Show that you care and be a responsible citizen of Sacramento by helping to preserve, protect, and beautify parks, facilities, natural areas, bike, pedestrian and equestrian trails for present and future generations. 

Between March and November, volunteers will have a chance to participate in tasks such as removing invasive plants and cleaning various parks, trails and nature areas managed by The City of Sacramento.

<b>Minimum Age: 5</b>

<b>Children under 18 are welcome.  However, they MUST be accompanied by adult volunteers at all time.  Youth volunteers also must submit a HOS Youth Waiver (see resource document below) prior to the project date.</b>  


Project Schedules:

September 2007
Volunteers will help remove invasive plants.

October 2007
Removing trash and invasive plants (star thistle) from a nature area.

March & June 2008
Volunteers will be taking out nonnative planes to promote the growth of native grasses. This is a wonderful opportunity to see some of the City of Sacramentos open spaces and see what a difference you can make in a shot amount of time.
	
September 2008
Volunteers will be picking up trash both large and small on and near the horse trail located in Del Paso Regional Park.  This is your chance to see some of the City of Sacramentos country roots and a lot of nature.

October 2008
Volunteers will help prun shrubs at one of the oldest parks in Sacramento.

November 2008
Volunteers will help with rose pruning in the Sacramento Bike Trails.


Park Operations is responsible for the maintenance of over 200 parks, including 3,000 acres of developed and undeveloped park land, 61 miles of off-road bikeways and bridges, 6 lakes and an extensive network of recreational fields and facilities.  

The system is growing at an extremely rapid pace with 37 park sites and 198 developed park acres to be added by the end of 2007.  The rate of growth is expected to continue in 2008 and beyond.</Description>

ITVS and the INDEPENDENT LENS 2008-09 SEASON 
A Film Festival in your community!

How did five female Army support soldiers--mechanics, supply clerks and engineers--end up fighting alongside the Marines in some of the bloodiest counterinsurgency battles of the Iraq War? Directors Meg McLagan and Daria Sommers give an intimate look at war through the eyes of the first women in U.S. history sent into direct ground combat, despite a policy that bans them from doing so. Through harrowing personal stories, these women candidly share their experiences in Iraq as well from their lives back home to form a portrait of the emotional and psychological effects of war.

      <Description>The Zoological Society of Florida (ZSF) is the non-profit support organization for Miami Metrozoo. ZSF was founded in 1956, when the Zoo was located in Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. Starting in the mid-Sixties, Zoo members spearheaded a campaign to include plans for a bigger, better zoo on the Dade County Decade of Progress bond issue. Voters approved the bond in 1972, and nine years later Miami Metrozoo opened its gates to the public at its current location. Today the zoo is 740 total acres and has 81 exhibits.

ZSF was founded in 1956, when the Zoo was located in Crandon Park on Key Biscayne. Starting in the mid-Sixties, Zoo members spearheaded a campaign to include plans for a bigger, better zoo on the Dade County Decade of Progress bond issue. Voters approved the bond in 1972, and nine years later Miami Metrozoo opened its gates to the public at its current location. Today the zoo is 740 total acres and has 81 exhibits.

  <Title>Marathon for Kids</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.laworks.com/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=918&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Marathon Kids is a twelve year old, nationally recognized, exercise and nutrition program for K-5th graders. It encourages children to lead a more active and healthy lifestyle by running 26.2 miles over the course of 6 months and eating 5-a-day fruits and vegetables. Currently, in the Los Angeles school district and many other cities nationwide, physical education classes are being cut from the daily curriculum. This situation has contributed to a rise in childhood obesity in Los Angeles from 20.2% in 1999 to 26.1% in 2006! 

We are currently seeking volunteers for our Kick-Off Event on the morning of Saturday, October 11, 2008, at Drake Stadium on the UCLA campus. Volunteer shifts start at either 6am (early shift) or 8am (late shift) and run to approximately noon. 

Volunteers generally help with tasks such as set-up, ushering the children to the start line, cheering on the children while they run, handing out finishing prizes, helping children to their buses, and clean-up.</Description>

Marathon Kids offers two free events for participating students and their families, as well as classroom packets and rewards upon completion. Last year, more than 10,000 LAUSD students completed the program and more than 100,000 participated in cities nationwide. CBS Nightly News covered last springs Final Mile event in Los Angeles, which can be viewed at www.cbsnews.com/2008/05/27/eveningnews/main4130458.shtml.

Our mission is to build a joyful community around children and be quickly accepted into public, private and home schools as a free, innovative, celebratory fitness and nutrition program, resonating with the child and with the child's family. The goal is for the child to develop the love and habit of moving through space and to carry forward the power of muscular, nutritional and psychological well being.   </Description>

  <Description>Come out to Lincoln Blvd. in the Marina del Rey/ Venice area and clean up litter BEFORE it makes it into the storm drains and out to our beaches! 

Santa Monica Baykeeper runs Adopt-A-Highway cleanups along Lincoln Blvd. on Saturday mornings. Volunteers arrive at 9am at the Baykeeper office in Marina del Rey near the intersection of Lincoln Blvd. and Washington Blvd. The volunteers get a quick 10 minute talk on safety issues involving working on a busy highway such as Lincoln Blvd. (yes, Lincoln Blvd is technically State Hwy 1). They are then geared up with orange safety vests, trash pickers (if they choose), Caltrans litter bags and maps where their clean up section is located. 

We have split Lincoln into three general areas and all are in need of clean up! Volunteers are asked to be back at the office by 11:45 where we do a quick summary/exit interview and we send them on their way. Most are glad they came out and started their weekend on a positive note. Some walk away with some interesting stories, whether it be a strange item they found or meeting some of the cool folks that come out. We even have a few regular volunteers that just like being out making a positive impact on their local community. So thats what we do, clean up trash before it makes it into the storm drain and out to the Bay.</Description>

This is a hands-on opportunity for volunteers to directly improve the condition of Santa Monica Bay beaches while enjoying the great outdoors. Volunteers help to remove foreign objects that detract from the beauty of the coastal beach area in Los Angeles County.

<IMG src="http://admin.laworks.com/uploaded_files/deliverFile.php/nothingbutsand1.jpg">
This project has a direct impact on the coastal communities of Los Angeles County. The projects promote a cleaner beach area and teach people that littering anywhere in Los Angeles County affects our beaches and oceans.

On the 3rd Saturday of each month, Heal the Bay offers its "Nothin' But Sand" beach cleanup. Each month the project takes place at a different beach between El Segundo and the Pacific Palisades. The specific beach location and directions will be sent to you by e-mail after you sign up.

<IMG src="http://admin.laworks.com/uploaded_files/deliverFile.php/nothingbutsand2.jpg">
Heal the Bay is a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to making Santa Monica Bay and Southern California coastal waters safe and healthy for people and marine life.

Volunteers for this project must be at least 6 years of age. A parent must accompany pre-teens.

Before signing up for this project by clicking on "Sign up for this project", any volunteer under the age of 18 will also need to print out a minor release form for this project.

  <Description>The providers of homeless services in Orange County regularly seek grant funding from state and federal agencies, and private funders to support their efforts countywide. This "Point-in-Time" count of the county's homeless population helps to confirm the need for these funds, and can be used to adjust service needs as appropriate. We need over 300 volunteers to actively participate in the process for counting individuals and families on the street and in sheltered facilities. After completion of the enumeration process, volunteers will survey a sample of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons, through one-on-one interviews to gather critical information to best assist them in moving to stable housing. The Survey process will take place over a two week period following the count. Please visit <a href="http://www.pointintimeoc.org">www.pointintimeoc.org</a> for further information.

There will be six Deployment Centers located throughout Orange County (to be determined in November).</Description>

      <Description>Orangewood Children's Foundation began 25 years ago with a vision to build a facility to shelter Orange County children who were the victims of abuse, neglect and abandonment.

After its construction, the operations and administration of the Orangewood Children's Home was turned over to the county's Social Services Agency.

Today our focus is on the ongoing needs of children in the foster care system, developing a wide range of activities, scholarships, support and programs to give every child every chance to succeed.</Description>

  <Description>Start a holiday tradition by helping others.  Ask your family, friends, place of business, and place of worship to get involved and help the homeless men, women & children that we serve.  Collect items to support those in crisis in our community.  Through the kindness of others, they are able to experience the excitement and joy of the holiday season.

  <Title>Home for the Holidays Adoption Event</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.volunteercenter.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=968&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>At the Irvine Animal Care Center, we try to find homes for the homeless animals of our community. Home for the Holidays is a fun, family event where many local animal rescue groups are invited to show their adoptable animals. There will be vendors, food, a raffle, silent auction, bake sale, and of course, Santa will be on hand to take pictures with families and pets.

On Dec. 6, we need men and/or tall people to help set up canopies, tables, and chairs for the event--though any and all help is greatly appreciated.

On event day, volunteers will help participants (vendors & rescuers) by assisting them with unloading their materials and animals; working with rescue groups by handling and showing dogs; working our various booths (silent auction, welcome booth, etc); monitoring the parking lot; and other miscellaneous duties. Groups are welcome!

  <Title>Operation Santa Claus</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.volunteercenter.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=953&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Last year, Operation Santa Claus (OSC) distributed more than 42,000 donated gifts and toys to underprivileged youth during the holiday season. Many of the children and teens served through this program have experienced abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Some are physically or mentally challenged. Others are homeless or live in temporary housing or group homes.

Beginning on November 19, toys and gifts donated by the community will be collected and taken to the OSC store where they will be prepared for distribution to needy children and teens. Throughout the months of November and December, volunteers will tackle the job of unloading donations from trucks, sorting toys, and stocking the store shelves with thousands of donated gifts. Volunteers should wear comfortable clothing and be prepared for light physical activity inside and outside the building.
________________________________________

Groups welcome - up to 12 volunteers per shift.

The minimum age is 16, though younger teens will be considered if accompanied by an adult.

Volunteers must sign up in advance and a map will be forwarded to each volunteer prior to the event.</Description>

  <Description>The children served through the Orange County Toy Collaborative come from low-income or impoverished households. Some have experienced abuse, neglect or abandonment. Others are homeless or live in temporary housing. Some experience serious health problems or may be physically or mentally challenged. 

Toys donated by the community will be collected and stored at the Orange County Toy Collaborative warehouse located at the former El Toro Marine Base in the City of Irvine. Volunteers will tackle the job of unloading, sorting, and packing the donated items for distribution to local charities. Volunteers should wear comfortable clothing and be prepared for light physical activity inside and outside the building.

________________________________________

The 6th annual Orphanage Holiday Trip and Pledge Campaign will be on December 6, 2008. 4 buses will depart Irvine at 6:30 AM to visit 4 different orphanages. This one day trip will bring good cheer and lots of love to many kids. CDV will provide lunch and the craft activity for the day. Cost is $40 plus a minimum of a $60 donation to help feed one child for one month. The trip schedule and registration form can be found at:

<a href="http://corazondevida.eventbrite.com/">http://corazondevida.eventbrite.com/</a>

This is also a major fundraiser for CDV so that we can start the new year with enough money to help feed and support over 750 children living at 14 Baja orphanages. We ask that everyone create their own online pledge campaign and send emails out to family and friends to donate:

  <DetailURL>http://www.volunteercenter.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=911&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>OCCORD is embarking on a community wide needs survey in the City of Anaheim. Volunteers will go door-to-door, interviewing residents and documenting the strengths, weaknesses, and any other information pertaining to community needs. This survey is the backbone to identifying community needs, and any volunteer will be an instrumental part of bringing a voice to those who often go unheard. Dress code: dress for the weather; bring comfortable shoes. Bilingual volunteers are a plus, but not a requirement. Also, a free lunch and a training on how to conduct the survey will be included.
 

Groups are welcomed!!!</Description>

  <Title>11th Annual Mens Day of Self-Esteem</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.volunteercenter.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=880&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Adults emerging from life crises need a major boost to their self-esteem to feel more positive about the future.  Planning for re-entry into the world of work poses real barriers to men who do not have the professional attire to make a good first impression in an interview.  This Day of Self-Esteem provides job-ready candidates with the final touches they need to feel confident on the job.  Volunteers will support clients and staff throughout the day, creating a positive experience.  Volunteers will be assigned to tasks such as Personal Shopping, Accessory Assistant, Registration, Greeter, Merchandiser, Hair/Massage Assistant, etc. Dress code for this event is business attire or business casual; though sneakers are okay. This is an all-day event so our only requirement is that volunteers stay until the finale.

Groups are welcomed!!!</Description>

  <Title>Los Angeles Times Festival of Books</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.handsoninlandempire.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=140&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Festival of Books began in 1996 with a simple goal: Bring together the people who create books and the people who love to read them. The Festival was an immediate success and has become Southern California's major literary event. This years Festival of Books will be held on Saturday, April 25 and Sunday, April 26.

Last year over 130,000 people attended the Festival, which featured almost a hundred ticketed author events, childrens storytelling, poetry readings, book signings and nearly 500 exhibitor booths. The Festivals success has been due in part to the generous assistance of volunteers who welcomed attendees, assisted with registration, staffed author events, supervised book signings and much more.

<b>Please Note </b> Signing up on this website does NOT register you as a volunteer. You must also sign up on the Festival of Books Volunteer website.

All applications must be received no later than Monday, April 6th. We will be unable to process applications received after that date. For questions and further information please call (213) 237-6503

Volunteer must be at least 18 years of age.</Description>

  <DetailURL>http://www.handsoninlandempire.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=9&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Do you enjoy mentoring and playing with kids?  

Each Tuesday Night, volunteers assist the clients of Inland Temporary Homes by providing much needed companionship and recreation for toddler, kids and teens while their parents attend classes to enhance their parenting skills.

Kids are split into age groups where volunteers facilitate age-appropriate arts, crafts, group activities and projects that will enhance the children's social and emotional development.  The first hour is spent on the lesson-plan, and the second hour is spent in free play with the children.

These kids love the attention and company you provide as a volunteer, and they'll bring out the child in you!  By working with these kids, volunteer help break the cycle of family homelessness by instilling skills and values that the children can utilize in the future. And you get to play!!!

Volunteers must be at least 18 years of age.

All volunteers signing up will be asked to bring one dish to feed up to eight people in the house. Youll be contacted by Brenda Miller the project leader once you sign up and told what to bring.  Thanks!  This will be a fun and rewarding evening for all!

  <Description><b> A HOIE Project</b>

Each month we gather a group of volunteers to assist residents at Plymouth Village with Arts and Crafts activities and to celebrate their birthdays.  Plymouth Village is a retirement community for seniors and those in need of assisted living.

Here's your chance to make a difference and develop a rewarding relationship with someone who will deeply value your company.  

This family friendly project allows volunteers to participate as a family, though volunteers under the age of 17 must be accompanied by a parent.  Volunteers should wear modest, conservative clothing.  (No tank tops, low-cut, torn jeans).  Unaccompanied 17-year old volunteers must have their parent or guardian complete a HOIE Liability and Release form for Minors.

  <Description> home for a family in San Bernardino. 

Hands On Inland Empire is organizing a crew to help on selected Saturdays. Each week will be a different stage of the build and all the equipment necessary will be provided. Lunch is also provided. 

It is a very rewarding and memorable experience to work alongside others building a home. No building experience is necessary and Habitat will only assign duties that fit each individuals comfort level. There are many duties that all volunteers can perform. 

Volunteers must be at least 14 years of age. Minors are not allowed to use power tools or climb.

Anyone under 18 must have their parent or guardian complete a HOIE Liability and Release form for Minors. For more information and to download the form, <a href=http://www.handsoninlandempire.org/AboutUs/index.php/youth.html>Click here.</a></p></Description>

  <Description><b>A HOIE Project</b>

The Loma Linda Ronald McDonald House is a home-away-from-home for families with children undergoing treatment for cancer and other serious illnesses at Loma Linda Childrens Hospital and other nearby facilities.

To keep the house family-friendly and a warm, caring place for families undergoing difficult times, Hands On Inland Empire brings volunteers in once a month to apply some tender loving care to the facility to keep things looking nice.  The spring cleaning we do varies from month to month, but can include gardening, raking, vacuuming, sorting donations, decorating the house or anything else we can do to make this house warm and welcoming. 

Individual volunteers or families are welcome.

Volunteers must be at least 13 years of age. 13 year olds must be accompanied by a parent. All volunteers under the age of 18 must have their parent or guardian complete a HOIE Liability and Release form for Minors. For more information and to download the form, <a href=http://www.handsoninlandempire.org/AboutUs/index.php/youth.html>Click here.</a></p></Description>

This project is open to all skills levels.  So all you have to do is show up, and if desired bring a pair of needles. No yarn needed at this point weve got plenty!

  <Description><b>A HOIE Project</b>

The David & Margaret Home is a Residential Treatment Program for girls aged 12 to 18, providing individual, group or family therapy as it aids girls who have come to them via the Juvenile Court System, Department of Mental Health, or Department of Child and Family Services.  The girls are in need of care, support and guidance. The residential program addresses the girls emotional, behavioral and educational needs. David & Margaret has 6 residential cottages, and Hands On Inland Empire has adopted one of these cottages in order to brighten the lives of the girls who live there.
 
We have adopted Tarr Cottage.  Tarr is the emancipation cottage for girls who are 16 - 18 and are working towards their emancipation day.  There will be a wide variety of activities planned at Tarr in 2008, including: game days, speakers and other professional activities, mentoring opportunities, "sprucing up" the cottage, and many other fun afternoons just being a friend to the girls. 

Volunteers must be 18 years of age, though volunteers are welcome to bring along their minor children, aged six and above to the project with the approval of the Project Leader.  You will get contact info for the Project Leader once you sign up for this project.</Description>

  <Description>Millions of Americans across the country are expected to spend Saturday, Oct. 25 the 18th Make A Difference Day - doing volunteer projects to improve their communities and help neighbors in need. The day is the largest community service effort in the nation, rallying corporations, government leaders, charitable organizations and everyday Americans into action on one day.

Volunteers from the High Desert will do yard work projects at a home owned by a senior, who finds it difficult to complete any yard work because of their disability, age or skills. The project will include minor clean up, raking leaves, trimming bushes, and weeding.

We have decided to help seniors clean up their yards because they are unable to do the task themselves. We are helping the seniors get rid of all the weeds because we live in the High Desert of California and fire season is upon us. California's worst fires all happened in October, 1991, 1995, and 2003. We want the homes to have some defensible space and get them ready for winter.

Volunteers must be 18 years of age and or older.

Here's your chance to make a difference and develop a rewarding relationship with someone who will deeply values your company.  Each month we are looking to gather a group of volunteers to share in some fun times with the senior by engaging them in an afternoon of board games and snacks.  Volunteers can bring their favorite board game to play or to donate a gameor puzzle to Hands On for future use for this project. Volunteers are also asked to bring a HEALTHY snack to serve at least 10 people, some snack suggestions are: sugar free snacks, low sodium crackers,veggies, fruits, and water.

Engage is a non profit organization who's vision is to make aging a beginning. They provide life-enhancing programs to low- and moderate-income seniors living in affordable apartment communities in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

  <Description><b>A HOIE Project</b>

Do you like to read aloud? Heres an opportunity to share your voice while helping others. The Upland Studio of Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic records digital textbooks ensuring that education remains accessible to those who cannot read for themselves.

Volunteers are needed to be recorded reading under the supervision of a Hands on Inland Empire Project Leader and RFB&D staff.  Teams digitally record textbooks in many subjects including history, math, sociology/psychology, medical, business and criminal justice.  Volunteers need to have sufficient vocabulary to understand meanings and pronunciations and clear speaking voices free from heavy accents.

Interested volunteers can choose to undergo further training if they wish to become long-term readers.  This project is a great way to be introduced to the rewarding work being done at RFB&D. 

Volunteers must be 18 years of age or older.

  <Description><b> A HOIE Project</b>

Homeless animals need your help.  These dogs and cats need human companionship to remind them what a loving family could be like. The time volunteers spend socializing these abused, abandoned and needy dogs and cats helps to make them adoptable and increases the odds that the shelter can find them new homes.

Volunteers will socialize dogs, cats, puppies and kittens by walking, playing and showering them with affection and attention. We'll also help around the shelter by filling water bowls, cleaning cat furniture, and generally lending a hand.

Volunteers must be at least 18 years of age.

West End Shelter for Animals is a no-kill pet placement and adoption center located in Ontario. The shelter was established in 1954 as the local humane society, and in 1994 was converted to the present no-kill alternative facility.</Description>

  <Title>Help Promote "Talk, Read, Play" with Countdown to Kindergarten</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=2065&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Countdown to Kindergarten engages families, educators and community members in a city-wide effort to celebrate and support the transition into kindergarten, a significant educational and developmental milestone for children and their families. 

To celebrate Bostons first ever "Talk, Read, Play" Day, volunteers will distribute promotional materials to raise awareness of a new campaign to support families as their childrens first teachers, called Talk, Read, Play. 

Volunteers will travel in small groups to downtown locations such as Faneuil Hall, South Station and Park Street Station, to hand out information cards about Talk, Read, Play and stickers for children, stating "Talk to Me." Volunteers will be given a T-shirt that says Talk, Read, Play Today that they will need to wear (and can keep). 

Volunteers will first meet for an orientation at the Countdown to Kindergarten office before heading out in small groups.

T-Accessible, Green/Blue Lines (Gov't Center); Orange Line (State).

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

      <Description>MISSION:
To care for individuals and families by providing exceptional human services and health care programs, guided by Jewish traditions of social responsibility, compassion and respect for all members of the community.

DESCRIPTION:
For over 140 years, Jewish Family and Childrens Service (JF&CS) has provided vital support for the people of Greater Boston at critical stages in their livesfrom newborns and their parents, to the elderly and families in crisis. JF&CS also serves delicate populations by offering adoption services, direct services to individuals with disabilities and mental health needs and many others.

The Community Housing for Adult Independence (CHAI) Services for People with Disabilities department was created in 1989. It is grounded in the belief that all people with disabilities should live with dignity in the community and enjoy the rights afforded their peers, regardless of their differences.

IMPACT:
With innovative programs, JF&CS continues to adapt to meet the changing needs of its community. While JF&CS remains committed to serving the Jewish community through unique and culturally competent programming, it also serves the greater community and more than 35 percent of the clients are non-Jewish. JF&CS collaborates with other social service and health care organizations throughout Greater Boston to offer a wide range of effective programs.

      <Name>Louisa May Alcott Orchard House</Name>
      <Description>MISSION:
To provide the financial and human resources required to offer public tours, educational programs and exhibits at the historic Orchard House, where the beloved classic, <i>Little Women</i>, was written and set in 1868. Also, to pursue preservation work that promotes and supports the legacy of the Alcotts, a unique 19th Century family with special interests in education, the arts, humanities and social justice.

DESCRIPTION:
A Historic Landmark on the National Register, Orchard House (c. 1690) is most noted as the home of Louisa May Alcott and her family, and the setting for the semi-autobiographical classic, <i>Little Women</i>. One of Americas most beloved and significant contributions to world culture, feminism and American family life studies, <i>Little Women</i> was also written at Orchard House in 1868. A second home to close friends Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne, Orchard House also witnessed the development of the only truly American philosophy, Transcendentalism. 

Today, Orchard House offers visitors the chance to learn about the Alcotts and their legacy through award-winning and nationally recognized guided tours, educational programs, special Living History events and youth workshops throughout the year.

IMPACT:
One of the earliest historic house museums in the country (opened in 1911), Orchard House ultimately offers visitors the ability to feel deep connections to the invaluable Alcott legacy.</Description>

      <Description>The mission of the Boston Classical Orchestra is to offer outstanding performances of the chamber orchestra repertoire in an intimate setting, concentrating on music of the Classical period.

Through imaginatively presented live concerts given in a relaxed atmosphere, the BCO seeks to foster a sense of connection between audience and performers and to strengthen its appeal to a growing and varied public.

Founded in 1980, the Boston Classical Orchestra performs in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall. The BCO is a fully professional chamber orchestra that performs five programs each season on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Each program is carefully crafted to encompass a broad spectrum of classical music appropriate for a Beethoven-era orchestra. A lecture about the music precedes both Friday and Sunday concerts, and the conductor offers brief spoken commentary about the music and musicians during the concerts.</Description>

  <Description>Food For Free responds to local hunger by rescuing fresh food that might otherwise go to waste and distributing it within the emergency food system where it can reach those in need.

In 1991, Food For Free planted their first Field of Greens. Each summer, they supplement the produce they rescue with nutrient-dense vegetables grown by our own staff and volunteers.  Volunteers are needed to help harvest summer crops, weed the current crops and do some planting.

      <Name>Food for Free/Field of Greens</Name>
      <Description>MISSION
The mission of Food for Free is to reduce the incidence of hunger, while preventing the waste of valuable food.

DESCRIPTION
Established in 1981, Food for Free (FFF) has grown from a small volunteer effort into a comprehensive, efficient and consistent food rescue program. FFF identifies and recaptures safe, nutritious food that would otherwise be discarded and distributes it to those in need.  Additionally, they work closely with food donors, recipients and the general public to increase the awareness of hunger and its fundamental causes. 

Food For Frees daily operationsgathering up and delivering food to nearly forty agenciesclosely corresponds to the education process they are involved ingathering information about the cultures, needs and wants of the people we serve and delivering that back to the farmers, wholesalers and grocers who provide the food. 

The Field of Greens program was founded in 1991 when FFF acquired its own organic farm in Lincoln, Mass.  Volunteers prepare soil, plant, weed and harvest the crops.  Collard greens, kale, and other vitamin dense foods are grown specifically to meet the needs of low-income residents.

IMPACT
Each year hundreds of bushels are distributed from Field of Greens to local meal programs and pantries.

  <Title>Help Kids & Families Dealing with Life Threatening Illnesses at Camp Sunshine</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=449&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Nestled alongside the shores of beautiful Sebago Lake, <ahref="http://www.campsunshine.org">Camp Sunshine</a> provides respite, support, joy and hope to children with life-threatening illnesses and their immediate families through various stages of a childs illness. The year-round program is free of charge to all families, and includes 24-hour onsite medical and psychosocial support.

The volunteer's role varies from working directly with kids in a group setting to supportive positions such as: working in the kitchen preparing meals or in the maintenance areas. On-site housing and all meals are provided. Its just over 2 ½ hours from Boston.

Each Camp Session is catered to a specific group of children and families.  

The June 6-10 (Friday to Tuesday) session is designated as solid organ transplant. 

The October 3-5 (Friday to Sunday) session is designated as Dana Farber.

The December 5-7 (Friday to Sunday) is designated as family holiday & celebration weekend.

While the project requires participants to volunteer for the entire weekend, as the camp orientation occurs at 11am on the first day of the project, volunteers need to only sign up for the first day. The Project Leader will add you to the other days so that your hours are tracked accordingly.  Also take note that you must fill out a volunteer application, and then return a volunteer acceptance form before you are fully added to the volunteer roster for the program.  Your Project Leader will send you the application after you sign up.

Please note that this project is in Casco, Maine.  A car pool will be arranged among volunteers.

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about Camp Sunshine:</strong>

"This has been one of the most rewarding and life changing experiences I have ever been a part of.  The children at Camp are incredible.  They have showed and taught me more about life and the value of family and friends than anyone else has.  This was an amazing experience and I can assure you that I will be going back for more." <em>~Adrian Budhu</em>


"Camp Sunshine is by far the most amazing project that I have ever been a part of.  My first visit to camp in April started to change my life, and it's incredible to watch that happening with other volunteers.  There is a sense of community, love and joy at Camp that infects everyone who walks through its door.  I can't wait to return.  It's an AMAZING place." <em>~Brandi Henson</em>

      <Description>MISSION:
To enrich the lives of babies born into poverty throughout their critical first three years of development. 

DESCRIPTION:
Room to Grow's program provides parents raising babies in poverty with one-on-one parenting support and essential baby items throughout their children's critical first three years of life. Parents expecting a baby are referred to Room to Grow by selected prenatal programs assisting low-income families. Upon their referral, parents visit Room to Grow's warm and inviting space once every three months from just before the birth of the baby until their child turns three. During their one-on-one appointments with our staff clinicians, typically lasting two hours, parents receive developmental information, customized support, and all of the needed baby items to ensure a healthy and secure start for their child.

IMPACT:
Since Room to Grow's founding in 1998, over 850 families have participated in its program. These families have made thousands of visits to its sites, meeting with clinicians every three months and receiving critical support and information to encourage and promote their children's healthy development. At the same time, Room to Grow has distributed over $4.5 million worth of new and nearly-new baby items to provide these children with a safe and enriched environment in which to grow, learn, and thrive.

Through imaginatively presented live concerts given in a relaxed atmosphere, the BCO seeks to foster a sense of connection between audience and performers and to strengthen its appeal to a growing and varied public.

Founded in 1980, the Boston Classical Orchestra performs in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall. The BCO is a fully professional chamber orchestra that performs five programs each season on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Each program is carefully crafted to encompass a broad spectrum of classical music appropriate for a Beethoven-era orchestra. A lecture about the music precedes both Friday and Sunday concerts, and the conductor offers brief spoken commentary about the music and musicians during the concerts.</Description>

  <Title>Usher at the Central Square Theater: "Einstein's Dreams"</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=2063&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Central Square Theater will provide a home to Underground Railway Theater (URT) and The Nora Theatre Company, two professional theater companies with a combined track record of over 48 years of excellence. This brand new theater opened its doors in July 2008. 

<b>About the show:</b> Based on the best-selling novel by MIT physicist Alan Lightman, "Einstein's Dreams" is set in Berne, Switzerland, 1905. The play portrays Einstein, a modest but brilliant patent clerk in a new marriage, struggling to make ends meet, while in the back of his mind re-conceiving time. Einstein performs acrobatics, both physically and mentally, and the audience is invited into reflections on time that range from whimsical to scientific to extremely personal.

Volunteers will be ushering at the show, as well as acting as ticket takers and directing traffic at the front doors of the theater.

There is a standard dress code for this project. Men: black or navy slacks with a solid white shirt. Tie is optional, but appreciated. Women: solid black or navy skirt or pants and a solid white blouse. Comfortable black shoes are a must for all volunteers. Please do not wear sandals, flip flops or hats.

Volunteers will be given free admission to the show at which they volunteer.

T-Accessible, Red Line (Central Square).

  <Description><i>Boston Cares is focusing on National Homelessness Awareness Month again this year with projects, events and programs about hunger and homelessness. We hope participants will become more educated about these issue areas in Massachusetts through participation.</i>

There are almost 517,000 hungry people in Eastern Massachusetts. It has been estimated that 40% of food in the United States is thrown away. Assist the Greater Boston Food Bank to inspect, sort, and box food to be sent to 600+ hunger relief agencies (food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, etc.). With your efforts you can help the Food Bank feed more than 87,000 hungry people per week.

The GBFB has over 650 food sources. One of their connections is with local grocers that donate food that might have been overproduced, incorrectly labeled or packaged, or is not selling well. They also accept donations from restaurants, universities, food drives, and individuals.

In addition to sorting and packaging food, volunteers will hear from the Executive Vice President of Development and Marketing from the Greater Boston Food Bank.  Volunteers will here about the role of philanthropy in the sustainability of non-profits and the effects of the current state of the economy. 

Volunteers must wear closed-toed shoes. This project can be physically tiring.

_______________________________________

Join Boston Cares as we discuss,<i> Learning Joy from Dogs without Collars</i>, with special guest, author Lauralee Summer. 

<img src="http://www.lauraleesummer.com/index_files/image13171.jpg"/>

Lauralee Summer grew up homeless and moved 20 times before she was 12. Despite the obstacles she faced in her childhood, she excelled academically and got into Harvard.  Lauralee went on to make history in the Ivy League when she became the first woman to join Harvards varsity wrestling team. After graduating from Harvard, she wrote a critically-acclaimed memoir, <i>Learning Joy from Dogs without Collars</i>, and then went on to attend graduate school at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Education. Today she is a high school teacher in the Boston Public Schools.

Her book,<i> Learning Joy from Dogs Without Collars</i>, is about, the memories of growing up, being raised by an eccentric and uniquely idealistic single mother. It is about how I was sometimes homeless and lived in shelters and in one apartment after another. It is about adventures my mother and I had, including moving across the country-from Astoria, Oregon, a small costal town, to Boston, Massachusetts, a bigger city on a different coast. It is about how I-by accident, it seemed-found myself to be the only girls on a high school wrestling team, how that worked out, and what I learned. The book is also about how I later went to Harvard, a world completely unlike the ones I grew up in: how I adapted to life there. It is about how I met my father when I was nineteen, and how my father finally became my dad. It is about all of these things and everything in between. It is the story of a girl coming into her own, learning and understanding her place in the world. It is about the innocence and resiliency of childhood- the space of happiness and joy which poverty was unable to demolish or diminish.

Each week, Generations Incorporated conducts 950 one-on-one reading interventions using a specified reading model. Each book in their site libraries has a companion book folder. These book folders act as guides for working with students and books. The guides play a critical role in improving a childs comprehension, oral vocabulary, and reading skills. 

Book folders are made by volunteers at this project to appeal to children 6-9 years old. Generations Incorporated supplies the information, as well as markers, colored pencils, stickers, glitter, and confetti to make the book folder attractive to the kids. 

Generations Incorporated needs volunteers to help create hundreds of new book folders.

      <Name>Big Sister Association Of Greater Boston</Name>
      <Description>DESCRIPTION
The Big Sister Association was founded in 1951 by three Cambridge residents who believed that girls in their community could benefit from the guidance and support of an older female friend. Originally providing six girls with mentors, today the Big Sister Association serves more than 1,800 girls annually through various mentoring programs. 

Currently, they offer three types of programs for young girls, Community-Based Mentoring, School-Based Mentoring and Group Mentoring. 

More than half of the girls Big Sister serves annually participate in Community-Based Mentoring programs.  These one-on-one mentoring opportunities match girls (Little Sisters) with caring and committed women volunteers (Big Sisters), who meet during days and times of their own choosing and at various locations throughout the greater community. 

Big Sisters newest program, School-Based Mentoring, is specifically designed for girls in elementary schools (approximately ages 7-11). Launched in 2001, School-Based Mentoring incorporates aspects of Big Sisters Community-Based Mentoring program, by individually matching girls with women volunteers, as well as aspects of our site-based models, by bringing adult mentors into girls educational environments. 

Big Sister offers two group mentoring programs for middle school girls (ages 12 to 15): Life Choices and TEAM (Team Enhanced Approach to Mentoring). As site-based programsLife Choices and TEAM groups are hosted by schools and neighborhood centers throughout Greater Bostonthese mentoring models create a safe space where girls can explore the many different choices and challenges they face in life. More than merely a place free of physical violence, these safe spaces create an atmosphere of intimacy and mutual respect where girls feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions with adults and 
with each other.

IMPACT
In 2002, Big Sister served 1,860 girls, a 44 percent increase over the number of girls served in 2000.

  <Description>Join Boston Cares for our Social Cinema screening of I.O.U.S.A. 

<a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/2igyni1.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a>

I.O.U.S.A. boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the United States and its citizens. Burdened with an ever-expanding government and military, increased international competition, overextended entitlement programs, and debts to foreign countries that are becoming impossible to honor, America must mend its spendthrift ways or face an economic disaster of epic proportions.

A discussion will directly follow the film. 

This event is part of Independent Lens, a monthly film series hosted in partnership with Boston Cares, WGBH, ITVS Community Cinema, Hostelling International, and The Boston Public Library. The Independent Lens series offers preview screenings of films covering a range of current social issues. It is intended to connect communities with organizations and information, and give citizens the opportunity to get involved.

This screening is free and open to the public. You do not have to be a member of Boston Cares to attend.

  <Description><b>Neighborhood projects are a Boston Cares Action Network initiative, meant to connect Boston Cares members who share a common neighborhood. This project is created and reserved for residents of Brookline. All residents of this area may sign up to participate alongside their neighbors!</b>

The Chestnut Hill Reservation Project was created to protect, restore, maintain and promote the landscape, waterways and parkways of the Chestnut Hill Reservation as it is a special place for people to visit and enjoy. The Chestnut Hill Reservation is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), which is steward of one of the largest state parks systems in the country.  Its 450,000 acres is made up of forests, parks, greenways, historic sites and landscapes, seashores, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and watersheds.

There will be a variety of tasks for volunteers to complete at the Reservation, which will vary depending on the size of the group. These tasks could include trail care and maintenance, brush trimming, and mixing and pouring concrete to install benches.

  <Description><i>Boston Cares is focusing on National Homelessness Awareness Month again this year with projects, events and programs about hunger and homelessness. We hope participants will become more educated about these issue areas in Massachusetts through participation. </i>

The American Red Cross works to provide relief to victims of disasters and help people prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies. 

The Boston Food Pantry provides a 3-day supply of emergency food to 4,500 low-income clients per month.

Volunteers will help distribute food to clients, prepare bags of perishable items for distribution, and pack food bags for the next distribution date.  Volunteers will also get a chance to hear from the Associate Director, David Andre, about how the food pantry originated, where it receives its food from, how clients can participate in the program, and what population the pantry serves.

Prison Book is a volunteer group committed to providing reading materials for prisoners around the country. Volunteers will read letters from prisoners and respond to them by choosing appropriate reading material to send back. Volunteers are welcome to bring paperback books to donate.

Volunteers will also have the satisfaction of knowing that they let someone behind bars know that they have been remembered on the outside.

      <Name>Prison Book Program</Name>
      <Description>MISSION
The Prison Book Program believes that literacy and access to reading materials are crucial for the personal, spiritual and political development of all people. Their main goals are to make reading materials available to incarcerated individuals who cannot obtain them otherwise and to foster communication between the community outside and the people inside the prison.

DESCRIPTION
The Prison Book Program has supplied individuals and groups of prisoners with quality reading material since 1972. Each week the Prison Book Program receives approximately 100 letters from prisoners around the country requesting reading material and/or information. The wide array of material they send includes dictionaries, legal self-help texts, GED manuals, historical books, spiritual works and literature. With each package of books, a prisoner receives a resource list that includes information on advocacy groups, health care information, Pen Pal programs, family support networks/groups, Gay/Lesbian, Bi Sexual and Transgender (GLBT) support groups, information on other book programs and outlets for their creativity. A postcard is sent separately to determine whether all the items were received by the prisoner or censored.

IMPACT
More than two million people are incarcerated in federal and state prisons and local jails. With educational programming being drastically cut, the Prison Book Program provides a vital service to inmates seeking to improve their education and prevent a return to prison.

  <Title>Serve & Learn: Success Stories at X-Cel Adult Education</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=1298&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>X-Cel, Inc. Adult Education was founded in 2000 by two adult educators with the vision of providing quality adult education services to residents of Greater Boston. X-Cels mission is to make high school completion and college-level study more accessible to low-income adults in Greater Boston, by providing flexible customized instruction at no cost in convenient community locations.

At this Serve & Learn, volunteers will spend an evening tutoring adults from all different cultures and levels of math proficiency. Additionally, participants will hear from X-Cel founder Don Sands about the programs history and mission then hear first hand about the successes of the program from one of the program's graduates.  

T-Accessible, Orange Line (Ruggles). 

This project is open to the public. You may participate by <a href="http://www.bostoncares.org/login/login.php?_mode=register">registering</a> with Boston Cares.

<b>What Boston Cares members have to say about GED math tutoring at X-Cel:</b>

"The event was put together really well. I had the opportunity to really help out students seeking help in math. All of the other volunteers were very nice and helped me get started, as this was my first time there." <i>~Sudip Dhingra</i>

"Knowledge is power, and every time I tutor at X-Cel education Im inspired as I watch motivated people from all walks of life empowering themselves. This is a very unique program: the students are committedthey want to be thereand they learn at their own pace, which means that tutors are important enablers. I will definitely continue to volunteer here." <i>~John Mayer</i>

I had never done math tutoring, but this project was AMAZING! Even though I haven't taken a math class in over 12 years, it all came back to me. It was a truly rewarding experience, and I'm so glad I did it. At the end of the evening, the woman with whom I was working asked me if I would be coming back next week because she told me she learned something from me and would like to work with me again. Wow!  <i>~Sarah Rocha</i></Description>

      <Name>Big Sister Association Of Greater Boston</Name>
      <Description>DESCRIPTION
The Big Sister Association was founded in 1951 by three Cambridge residents who believed that girls in their community could benefit from the guidance and support of an older female friend. Originally providing six girls with mentors, today the Big Sister Association serves more than 1,800 girls annually through various mentoring programs. 

Currently, they offer three types of programs for young girls, Community-Based Mentoring, School-Based Mentoring and Group Mentoring. 

More than half of the girls Big Sister serves annually participate in Community-Based Mentoring programs.  These one-on-one mentoring opportunities match girls (Little Sisters) with caring and committed women volunteers (Big Sisters), who meet during days and times of their own choosing and at various locations throughout the greater community. 

Big Sisters newest program, School-Based Mentoring, is specifically designed for girls in elementary schools (approximately ages 7-11). Launched in 2001, School-Based Mentoring incorporates aspects of Big Sisters Community-Based Mentoring program, by individually matching girls with women volunteers, as well as aspects of our site-based models, by bringing adult mentors into girls educational environments. 

Big Sister offers two group mentoring programs for middle school girls (ages 12 to 15): Life Choices and TEAM (Team Enhanced Approach to Mentoring). As site-based programsLife Choices and TEAM groups are hosted by schools and neighborhood centers throughout Greater Bostonthese mentoring models create a safe space where girls can explore the many different choices and challenges they face in life. More than merely a place free of physical violence, these safe spaces create an atmosphere of intimacy and mutual respect where girls feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions with adults and 
with each other.

IMPACT
In 2002, Big Sister served 1,860 girls, a 44 percent increase over the number of girls served in 2000.

      <Description>More Than Words (formerly Teen LEEP)  empowers youth with entrepreneurial jobs helping to manage a bookselling business.  In addition to spending time in a productive work environment and earning much needed money, the youth have a supportive opportunity to develop the necessary technology, social and professional skills and behaviors critical for success in the world of work.

Youth residing in group homes and Independent Living Programs are employed anywhere between 4-25 hours per week to help operate the business and also to participate in skill building workshops.  The employment experience is structured to provide clear and consistent expectations for the youth to learn what is required in a professional job, and supervisors provide ample feedback and guidance for youth to learn to self-evaluate their performance.  Additionally, as youth are ready, they are given increasing responsibility for managing various facets of the business ranging from interviewing and training new employees, supervising shifts, managing projects and developing peer training workshops.  

Teen LEEP launch an online bookselling pilot venture in the summer of 2004. This served as a vehicle for youth preparing to age out of the foster care system to spend time in a productive work environment and earn much need money, while developing the necessary technology, social and professional skills critical for success in the world of work.  In June 2005, Teen LEEP experienced exciting growth by moving the online bookselling venture to a storefront operation called More Than Words bookstore, which also doubles a youth art gallery and space for spoken word and community events.  The youth continue to run the online business and also manage the retail component, which provides critical opportunities to hone customer service and communication skills. The store offers youth increased opportunities for employment, entrepreneurship and leadership development.

      <Description>MISSION
The Prison Book Program believes that literacy and access to reading materials are crucial for the personal, spiritual and political development of all people. Their main goals are to make reading materials available to incarcerated individuals who cannot obtain them otherwise and to foster communication between the community outside and the people inside the prison.

DESCRIPTION
The Prison Book Program has supplied individuals and groups of prisoners with quality reading material since 1972. Each week the Prison Book Program receives approximately 100 letters from prisoners around the country requesting reading material and/or information. The wide array of material they send includes dictionaries, legal self-help texts, GED manuals, historical books, spiritual works and literature. With each package of books, a prisoner receives a resource list that includes information on advocacy groups, health care information, Pen Pal programs, family support networks/groups, Gay/Lesbian, Bi Sexual and Transgender (GLBT) support groups, information on other book programs and outlets for their creativity. A postcard is sent separately to determine whether all the items were received by the prisoner or censored.

IMPACT
More than two million people are incarcerated in federal and state prisons and local jails. With educational programming being drastically cut, the Prison Book Program provides a vital service to inmates seeking to improve their education and prevent a return to prison.

  <Description><i>Boston Cares is focusing on National Homelessness Awareness Month again this year with projects, events and programs about hunger and homelessness. We hope participants will become more educated about these issue areas in Massachusetts through participation.</i>

There are almost 517,000 hungry people in Eastern Massachusetts. It has been estimated that 40% of food in the United States is thrown away. Assist the Greater Boston Food Bank to inspect, sort, and box food to be sent to 600+ hunger relief agencies (food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, etc.). With volunteer efforts,  the Food Bank can feed more than 87,000 hungry people per week.

The GBFB has over 650 food sources. One of their connections is with local grocers that donate food that might have been overproduced, incorrectly labeled or packaged, or is not selling well. They also accept donations from restaurants, universities, food drives, and individuals.

Volunteers must wear closed-toed shoes. This project can be physically tiring.

<i>Kid-friendly, 16+.</i>

      <Description>The goal of The Greater Boston Food Bank is to help end hunger in eastern Massachusetts by acquiring and distributing as much food as possible; promoting nutrition education and hunger awareness in the community; and developing and sustaining partnerships with others who care.

Founded in 1981, The Food Bank is part of the America's Second Harvest National Network, the nation's largest hunger-relief organization.  The Food Bank serves as a non-profit clearinghouse for food donated by the private sector to help feed the hungry. They employ 55 people and utilize the services of 10,500 volunteers annually to acquire, inspect, sort, warehouse, and distribute enormous quantities of food.  Day and night, weekdays and weekends, their 60,000 square-foot facility, loading docks and fleet of trucks are put to work to feed hungry people.

The Food Bank is the largest hunger-relief organization in New England, and the eighth largest member of Second Harvest.  Their network of 700 hunger-relief agencies distribute nearly 24 million pounds of food annually and feed more than 87,000 people weekly through about 750 hunger-relief agencies. More than 2,150 community volunteers donate in excess of 48,000 hours annually to The Food Bank.

  <Title>Usher at the Huntington Theatre: Tom Stoppard's "Rock & Roll"</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=2054&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Huntington Theatre Company, a non-profit organization in residence at Boston University, has been Bostons leading professional theatre company for a quarter-century.

Volunteers are needed to usher the show and also stuff and distribute programs, and do a light cleaning after the performance.

<b>About the show:</b> Its August 1968, and Russian tanks are rolling into Prague. By 1990, the tanks are rolling out, and the Stones are rolling in. A sweeping drama spanning two countries, three generations, and 22 turbulent years, at the end of which all that remains is love  and rock n roll. An extraordinary theatrical event from four-time Tony Award winner Tom Stoppard (<i>Arcadia</i> and <i>The Coast of Utopia</i>), fresh from hit runs on Broadway and in London. A co-production with San Franciscos American Conservatory Theatre. "Stoppard's finest play! It had me hooked."  Ben Brantley, <i>The New York Times</i>.

Volunteers must wear black bottoms and white tops. Be prepared for downtime before the show (bring a book if necessary) because you will not know if there are programs to stuff until you arrive.

  <Description>Each week, Generations Incorporated conducts 950 one-on-one reading interventions using a specified reading model. Each book in their site libraries has a companion bookfolder. These bookfolders act as guides for working with students and books. The guides play a critical role in improving a childs comprehension, oral vocabulary, and reading skills. 

Bookfolders are made by volunteers at this project to appeal to children 6-9 years old. Generations Incorporated supplies the information, as well as markers, colored pencils, stickers, glitter, and confetti to make the bookfolder attractive to the kids. 

Generations Incorporated needs volunteers to help create hundreds of new bookfolders.

  <Title>Serve & Learn: Grant a Wish at the Lowell Wish Project</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=829&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Lowell is home to many historic sites, but is also home to many needy families as well. At this Serve & Learn, volunteers will dedicate their service to the Lowell Wish Project (LWP), a goods bank for low-income families provided through social services. The volunteers will help by sorting and organizing incoming donations. In addition, volunteers will hear a talk about the population that LWP serves and the issues that needy families face. 

The Lowell Wish Project coordinates the delivery of goods, such as clothing and household items, to these families through case workers that know them best. Most agencies that LWP works with are from the Greater Lowell and Lawrence area, although they also help out in Newburyport and up to Southern N.H. The clients served include families, battered women, children, teens and single adults in shelter, children with AIDS, and new immigrants from more than 14 countries. 

From January to December of 2006, LWP helped more than 17,000 clients get more than $560,000 worth of basic home and baby goods. More than 80 percent of clients are women and children. 

Carpools are available for this project. E-mail the project leader for information.

      <Name>Baby Basics</Name>
      <Description>Baby Basics, Inc. is a nonprofit volunteer organization that provides and distributes diapers to babies of the working/near poor in the community of South Boston.  They believe that early intervention with infants is one of the best ways to maximize their potential to thrive.   They also provide these families who are struggling to make ends meet but have incomes too high to qualify for federal and state subsidies, with a supportive safety net from welfare.  Baby Basics strives to provide a caring community of support for these families, hopefully relieving their sense of isolation.

Baby Basics operates with the aid of volunteers and a working Board.  Diapers are distributed to participating families twice monthly.  The families they support must meet certain income guidelines, not receive any state or federal financial aid, have one working parent and live in South Boston.  Children from these families will receive diapers from birth to age three.   They rely on private donations and fundraisers, 100% of which goes towards the purchase of diapers.  Administrative costs are underwritten by donations earmarked as such.  By providing these children with diapers, they are ensuring that the need for hygienic essentials is met.  They also provide a caring environment, and, as needed, referrals for help or connections to other programs and services in South Boston.

Baby Basics, Inc. currently serves 50 families and children from South Boston. They distribute over 75,000 diapers per year.</Description>

  <Title>Usher at the Central Square Theater: "Martha Mitchell Calling"</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=2062&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Central Square Theater will provide a home to Underground Railway Theater (URT) and The Nora Theatre Company, two professional theater companies with a combined track record of over 48 years of excellence. This brand new theater opened its doors in July 2008. 

<b>About the show:</b> Martha Mitchell Calling is the story of the outspoken, flamboyant and courageous wife of John Mitchell, Attorney General during the Nixon Administration. A scintillating spokeswoman, and the life of the Republican party (Nixon called Martha "his secret weapon"), she is passionately adored by her husband ("When I met Martha she was conservative in her politics but liberal where it counts...") until the Watergate cover-up takes over and she blows the whistle, blows up her marriage, and helps bring down a Presidency.

Volunteers will be ushering at the show, as well as acting as ticket takers and directing traffic at the front doors of the theater.

There is a standard dress code for this project. Men: black or navy slacks with a solid white shirt. Tie is optional, but appreciated. Women: solid black or navy skirt or pants and a solid white blouse. Comfortable black shoes are a must for all volunteers. Please do not wear sandals, flip flops or hats.

Volunteers will be given free admission to the show at which they volunteer.

T-Accessible, Red Line (Central Square).

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

      <Description>MISSION
To protect the nature of Massachusetts.

DESCRIPTION
Massachusetts Audubon Society is the largest conservation organization in New England, concentrating its efforts on protecting the nature of Massachusetts for people and wildlife.   Established in 1896, Mass Audubon was the leader of a new effort to conserve nature in the United States.  Drumlin Farm became a wildlife sanctuary in 1955 when it was given to Mass Audubon by Louise Ayer Hatheway.  In her bequest, she advised that Mass Audubon continue to use the farm as a way to educate local children, families and adults about how their food is produced.

IMPACT
Mass Audubon protects more than 30,000 acres of conservation land, conducts educational programs for 250,000 children and adults annually, and advocates for sound environmental policies at the local, state, and federal levels.   Mass Audubon is supported by 68,000 member households and maintains 42 wildlife sanctuaries that are open to the public and serve as the base for its conservation, education, and advocacy work across the state. Drumlin Farm educates nearly 100,000 visitors annually about sustainable farming and the natural history of its fields, woods and wildlife.

  <Description>Join Boston Cares as we discuss, The Crime of the Century: How the Brinks Robbers Stole Millions and the Hearts of Boston with author Stephanie Schorow.

<img src= "http://stephanieschorow.com/images/sschorow-210-Crimecentury3.jpg"/>

On January 17, 1950, seven robbers in Halloween masks walked into a counting room of the Brinks armored car garage on Prince Street in Boston and walked out with $2.5 million in cash, checks, and securities. It was the largest robbery in U.S. history to date. Yet not a shot was fired, not a drop of blood shed. The robbers simply said, This is a stick-up, before gagging and tying up the guards. Within minutes they escaped into the night with bags stuffed with money, leaving almost no clues behind. For six years authorities worked to crack the case. Just before the statute of limitations ran out, one of the robbers, who believed he was cheated out of his share, ratted out his comrades. The subsequent trial captivated a city, as details of the caper finally came to light. Yet most of the loot was never found, and over the years Bostonians have speculated on where it went. Even after the case was solved and the culprits were jailed, the Brinks robbery continued to fascinate the public. How did a ragtag group of petty criminals Irish, Italian, and one Jewsomehow pull off a nearly perfect crime? Hollywood made two movies that portrayed the robbers as working-class heroes. A closer examination of the robbery, however, reveals a darker side. What first appeared to be a daring, bloodless caper turned deadly when the lure of the cash and the fear of imprisonment turned friend against friend. Soon the criminal code of silence was being enforced with the blast of a machine gun. To this day mystery and intrigue surround the Brinks robbery even as it continues to grip the imagination of Boston.

This program is offered in conjunction with a service project. Make the shift into civic engagement by using what youve learned by volunteering at a project. Join Boston Cares for the Prison Book Program. The Prison Book Program has been supplying individuals and groups of prisoners with quality reading material since 1972. With 2 million people locked up in Americas federal and state prisons and local jails, and with educational programming being drastically cut, the need for the Prison Book Program's services has never been greater. Education is the only tool proven to help prevent people from returning to prison again and again. Volunteers will read letters from prisoners, fill their book requests, and package the books to be shipped.

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about GED Writing and Reading Tutoring at X-Cel Adult Education:</strong>

"As always, this was a great class.  I had never taught adults before and was a little unsure about what to expect, but the experience turned out to be completely positive.  The students at X-Cel were fantastic, eager to learn, and I felt very supported as a new volunteer coming in.  I plan to continue working with the volunteers and students at X-cel." <em>~Whitney Grace</em>

Each book in their site libraries has a companion bookfolder. These bookfolders act as guides for working with students and books. The guides play a critical role in improving a childs comprehension, oral vocabulary, and reading skills.

Bookfolders are made by volunteers at this project to appeal to children 6-9 years old. Generations Incorporated supplies the information, as well as markers, colored pencils, stickers, glitter, and confetti to make the bookfolder attractive to the kids.

Generations Incorporated needs volunteers to help create hundreds of new bookfolders.

<strong>Boston Cares has a large supply of donated yarn for this knitting group.  If you are interested in using this yarn, please email kclark@bostoncares.org.

      <Description>The mission of the Boston Classical Orchestra is to offer outstanding performances of the chamber orchestra repertoire in an intimate setting, concentrating on music of the Classical period.

Through imaginatively presented live concerts given in a relaxed atmosphere, the BCO seeks to foster a sense of connection between audience and performers and to strengthen its appeal to a growing and varied public.

Founded in 1980, the Boston Classical Orchestra performs in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall. The BCO is a fully professional chamber orchestra that performs five programs each season on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Each program is carefully crafted to encompass a broad spectrum of classical music appropriate for a Beethoven-era orchestra. A lecture about the music precedes both Friday and Sunday concerts, and the conductor offers brief spoken commentary about the music and musicians during the concerts.</Description>

      <Name>Big Sister Association Of Greater Boston</Name>
      <Description>DESCRIPTION
The Big Sister Association was founded in 1951 by three Cambridge residents who believed that girls in their community could benefit from the guidance and support of an older female friend. Originally providing six girls with mentors, today the Big Sister Association serves more than 1,800 girls annually through various mentoring programs. 

Currently, they offer three types of programs for young girls, Community-Based Mentoring, School-Based Mentoring and Group Mentoring. 

More than half of the girls Big Sister serves annually participate in Community-Based Mentoring programs.  These one-on-one mentoring opportunities match girls (Little Sisters) with caring and committed women volunteers (Big Sisters), who meet during days and times of their own choosing and at various locations throughout the greater community. 

Big Sisters newest program, School-Based Mentoring, is specifically designed for girls in elementary schools (approximately ages 7-11). Launched in 2001, School-Based Mentoring incorporates aspects of Big Sisters Community-Based Mentoring program, by individually matching girls with women volunteers, as well as aspects of our site-based models, by bringing adult mentors into girls educational environments. 

Big Sister offers two group mentoring programs for middle school girls (ages 12 to 15): Life Choices and TEAM (Team Enhanced Approach to Mentoring). As site-based programsLife Choices and TEAM groups are hosted by schools and neighborhood centers throughout Greater Bostonthese mentoring models create a safe space where girls can explore the many different choices and challenges they face in life. More than merely a place free of physical violence, these safe spaces create an atmosphere of intimacy and mutual respect where girls feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions with adults and 
with each other.

IMPACT
In 2002, Big Sister served 1,860 girls, a 44 percent increase over the number of girls served in 2000.

  <Description>X-Cel, Inc. Adult Education was founded in 2000 by two adult educators with the vision of providing quality adult education services to residents of Greater Boston. X-Cels mission is to make high school completion and college-level study more accessible to low-income adults in Greater Boston, by providing flexible customized instruction at no cost in convenient community locations.

Try your hand at teaching. Join X-Cel for an evening of tutoring adults from all different cultures and levels of math proficiency. If you graduated from high school, you already have the knowledge to teach these eager-to-learn adults. No previous teaching experience necessary. 

Volunteers are encouraged to bring their own pencils and scrap paper.

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

<em>If volunteers are interested, the project leader is willing to provide a ride/set up a carpool from the T for any of the dates.</em>  


<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about GED math tutoring at X-Cel:</strong>

"The event was put together really well.  I had the opportunity to really help out students seeking help in math.  All of the other volunters were very nice and helped me get started, as this was my first time there." <em>~Sudip Dhingra</em>

  <Title>Social Cinema: Lioness</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=1988&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>Join Boston Cares for our Social Cinema screening of Lioness.

<img src="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/photos/prev_fall_08/phprev_lioness.jpg"/>

Lioness tells the story of a group of female Army support soldiers who became the first women in American history to be sent into direct ground combat. Without sufficient training but with a commitment to serve as needed, these young women ended up fighting in some of the bloodiest counterinsurgency battles of the Iraq war. Lioness makes public, for the first time, this hidden history.

Told through intimate accounts, journal excerpts, archival footage, as well as interviews with military commanders, the film follows five Lioness women who served together for a year in Iraq. With captivating detail, this probing documentary reveals the unexpected consequences that began by using these Army women to defuse tensions with local civilians, but resulted in their fighting alongside Marine combat units in the streets of Ramadi. Together the women's candid narratives describing their experiences in Iraq and scenes from their lives back home form a portrait of the emotional and psychological effects of war from a female point of view.
 
A panel discussion will directly follow the film.

This event is part of Independent Lens, a monthly film series hosted in partnership with Boston Cares, WGBH, ITVS Community Cinema, Hostelling International, and The Boston Public Library. The Independent Lens series offers preview screenings of films covering a range of current social issues. It is intended to connect communities with organizations and information, and give citizens the opportunity to get involved.

This screening is free and open to the public. You do not have to be a member of Boston Cares to attend.

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about GED math tutoring at X-Cel:</strong>

"The event was put together really well.  I had the opportunity to really help out students seeking help in math.  All of the other volunteers were very nice and helped me get started, as this was my first time there." <em>~Sudip Dhingra</em>

"Knowledge is power, and every time I tutor at X-Cel education Im inspired as I watch motivated people from all walks of life empowering themselves.  This is a very unique program: the students are committedthey want to be thereand they learn at their own pace, which means that tutors are important enablers.  I will definitely continue to volunteer here." <em>~John Mayer</em>

I had never done math tutoring, but this project was AMAZING!  Even though I haven't taken a math class in over 12 years, it all came back to me.  It was a truly rewarding experience, and I'm so glad I did it.  At the end of the evening, the woman with whom I was working asked me if I would be coming back next week because she told me she learned something from me and would like to work with me again.  Wow!  <em>~Sarah Rocha</em>

At the end of the evening, the woman with whom I was working asked me if I would be coming back next week because she told me she learned something from me and would like to work with me again.  Wow!  <em>~Sarah Rocha</em>

  <Description>Lowell is home to many historic sites, but is also home to many needy families as well. Lowell Wish Project (LWP) is a goods bank for families in need.

The Lowell Wish Project coordinates the delivery of goods, such as clothing and household items, to these families through case workers that know them best. Most agencies that LWP works with are from the Greater Lowell and Lawrence area, although they also help out in Newburyport and up to Southern N.H. The clients served include families, battered women, children, teens and single adults in shelter, children with AIDS, and new immigrants from more than 14 countries.

From January to December of 2006, LWP helped more than 17,000 clients get more than $560,000 worth of basic home and baby goods. More than 80 percent of clients are women and children.

Volunteers will be sorting through donations of everything from clothing to kitchen supplies to sheets and blankets.

<strong>Please be sure to dress warmly - the warehouse is cold in the winter!  Also, contact the Project Leader if you are interested in arranging a car pool.</strong>

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about Recording Textbooks at Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic:</strong>

This was one of my favorites!  It was so neat to sit in a recording booth and record stories to be read by people who cant see or understand the written word.  The staff was super sweet!  I am referring all of my friends to go and check it out as well. <em>~Melissa Scarry</em>

  <Description>The Boston Night Center is an overnight drop-in center for 60-70 men and women, offering an alternative to shelters with staff that provide referrals to emergency substance abuse and mental health services.  Volunteers assist with the late night dinner service.  

When volunteers arrive the clients will already have lined up for dinner, so they should politely go to the front of the line and explain that they are a volunteer to the staff.

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.  

T-Accessible, Government Center station or State Street station.

      <Name>Jewish Family & Children's Service</Name>
      <Description>MISSION:
To care for individuals and families by providing exceptional human services and health care programs, guided by Jewish traditions of social responsibility, compassion and respect for all members of the community.

DESCRIPTION:
For over 140 years, Jewish Family and Childrens Service (JF&CS) has provided vital support for the people of Greater Boston at critical stages in their livesfrom newborns and their parents, to the elderly and families in crisis. JF&CS also serves delicate populations by offering adoption services, direct services to individuals with disabilities and mental health needs and many others.

The Community Housing for Adult Independence (CHAI) Services for People with Disabilities department was created in 1989. It is grounded in the belief that all people with disabilities should live with dignity in the community and enjoy the rights afforded their peers, regardless of their differences.

IMPACT:
With innovative programs, JF&CS continues to adapt to meet the changing needs of its community. While JF&CS remains committed to serving the Jewish community through unique and culturally competent programming, it also serves the greater community and more than 35 percent of the clients are non-Jewish. JF&CS collaborates with other social service and health care organizations throughout Greater Boston to offer a wide range of effective programs.

The Esplanade Association is a non-profit friends group working to restore, preserve and enhance the historic Charles River Esplanade as a vital urban park to be enjoyed by all.

DESCRIPTION
The Esplanade Association is a dynamic nonprofit collaboration of citizens working to protect, restore, and beautify Bostons historic Charles River Esplanade. One of the oldest, most dramatic, and most popular urban parks in the country, the Esplanade comprises three miles of parkland stretching along the shore of the Charles River from the Museum of Science to the Boston University Bridge. 
The Esplanade is where many of the citizens of Boston celebrate the seasons, and the Esplanade Association is dedicated to enhancing the parks ability to serve them. The Association is also committed to building partnerships, raising funds to restore and care for the Esplanade, and recruiting volunteers to carry out their mission.

To achieve their goals for the Esplanade, they work closely with the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the state agency charged with care of the park. The Association also established productive partnerships with other corporations, nonprofits, and government agencies. The Esplanade Association is currently working to restore historic granite landings and memorials, renovate wooden docks, revitalize the landscape, improve the Charles bank recreational area, expand community outreach programs, and augment maintenance efforts.

IMPACT
Some of the  Esplanade Associations numerous accomplishments include constructing the Miriam and Sidney Stoneman Playground, donating 12 kayaks to Community Boating, successfully advocating for the repair and refurbishment of the pedestrian footbridges that cross Storrow Drive, expanding outreach efforts to inner-city children, and funding of a Project Place group to help Department of Conservation and Recreation staff maintain the Esplanade and sponsored regular community cleanups.

"This is one of the best projects I have ever worked on in 6 years of being a member!  The staff at MSPCA were wonderful and made you feel welcome.  I will definitely be doing this project again." <em>~Kelly Novak</em>

Volunteers arrive 2-1/2 hours prior to kick off and sell, sell, sell programs through halftime or until the supply runs out. Volunteers are free to stay and enjoy the rest of the game after their service. 

Volunteers are needed for the following games (kick-off times for some games are TBD):

Sept. 6: vs. Georgia Tech
Sept. 20: vs. UCF
Sept. 27: vs. Rhode Island
Oct. 18: vs. Virginia Tech
Nov. 1: vs. Clemson
Nov. 8: vs. Notre Dame
Nov. 29: vs. Maryland

Groups are welcome, but remember we are counting on EVERYONE who volunteers to attend.

<b>PLEASE NOTE the times listed below may change slightly as the kick-off times for the season are still TBD with the exception of the season opener. Volunteers will be notified as soon as the kick-off time is finalized. We appreciate your flexibility.</b>

This project is open to the public. You may participate by <a href="http://www.bostoncares.org/login/login.php?_mode=register">registering</a> with Boston Cares.

  <Title>Select Books for Prisoners at Prison Book Program</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.bostoncares.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=99&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The Prison Book Program has been supplying individuals and groups of prisoners with quality reading material since 1972.  With 2 million people locked up in Americas federal and state prisons and local jails, and with educational programming being drastically cut, the need for the Prison Book Program's services has never been greater. Education is the only tool proven to help prevent people from returning to prison again and again.

Volunteers will read letters from prisoners, fill their book requests, and package the books to be shipped.

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about Select Books for Prisoners at the Prison Book Program:</strong>

It was great.  The organizers are warm and helpful.  They really prepared me well for the work we were doing, and provided information on the greater problem.  I am definitely going back. <em>~Nicole Daley</em>

"I really enjoyed by experience with PBP.  The leaders were very kind and helpful.  The most rewarding part was thinking about the reactions of the prisoners for whom I chose books.  I plan to go back as often as my schedule permits!" <em>~Kimberly Mitchell</em>

      <Name>Prison Book Program</Name>
      <Description>MISSION
The Prison Book Program believes that literacy and access to reading materials are crucial for the personal, spiritual and political development of all people. Their main goals are to make reading materials available to incarcerated individuals who cannot obtain them otherwise and to foster communication between the community outside and the people inside the prison.

DESCRIPTION
The Prison Book Program has supplied individuals and groups of prisoners with quality reading material since 1972. Each week the Prison Book Program receives approximately 100 letters from prisoners around the country requesting reading material and/or information. The wide array of material they send includes dictionaries, legal self-help texts, GED manuals, historical books, spiritual works and literature. With each package of books, a prisoner receives a resource list that includes information on advocacy groups, health care information, Pen Pal programs, family support networks/groups, Gay/Lesbian, Bi Sexual and Transgender (GLBT) support groups, information on other book programs and outlets for their creativity. A postcard is sent separately to determine whether all the items were received by the prisoner or censored.

IMPACT
More than two million people are incarcerated in federal and state prisons and local jails. With educational programming being drastically cut, the Prison Book Program provides a vital service to inmates seeking to improve their education and prevent a return to prison.

<strong>What Boston Cares members have to say about Arts and Crafts with kids at St. Mary's Women and Infant Center:</strong>

"I thought this was excellent.  It was nice to be able to sit and talk with the residents." <em>~Marcia Flaherty</em>  

"This is a wonderful project.  The leader came prepared with an amazing amount of supplies, the kids loved expanding upon the project and the volunteers were really into it as well.  I am always surprised that the kids stay occupied with arts and crafts for 2 hours, but they do, and they are well-behaved and attentive...Each volunteer was able to devote a lot of individual attention to the kids, helping to foster one-on-one conversations/guidance.  This has become a project that I make an effort to do on a regular basis." <em>~Boston Cares member</em>

DESCRIPTION
The Vietnam Veterans Workshop d/b/a the New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans (NESHV) is a substance-free, not-for-profit organization dedicated to creating a one-stop service center to empower homeless veterans to address the issues leading to homelessness and unemployment and to gain the tools to move toward independent living. NESHV provides a wide spectrum of supportive services that include housing, counseling, vocational training, job search workshops, living skills and health-related programs. NESHV is recognized as one of the most effective private veteran's transition programs in the country.

The Shelters proven program for homeless and at-risk veterans has a track record of success founded on veterans helping veterans. Their program is one of the nation's best because it draws on veterans shared experiences with fellow veterans who are succeeding at bettering themselves.

This project is reserved for Boston Cares members who have attended an orientation.

TML's primary focus is in the southwest quadrant of Overtown and Downtown Miami. Downtown Miami and Overtown is a small inner-city community of 12,000 people in the midst of metropolitan Miami-Dade (2.3 million). This area is the poorest community in the State of Florida.

      <Description>About Historic Virginia Key Beach Park 

Listed on the U.S. Park Service National Register of Historic Places, the beach has a rich cultural history and played a significant role in the U.S. Civil Rights movement of South Florida.  Historic Virginia Key Beach Park is a treasured living legacy of land, history and beauty, past and future.  From the 1920s to the Civil Rights era, Historic Virginia Key Beach Park was a cherished getaway, religious sacred site and social gathering haven for Miamis Colored Community.  The Virginia Key Beach Park Trust has now been entrusted to oversee the restoration and development of the parkland site.  Historic Virginia Key Beach Park will offer a glimpse of the past, an appreciation for nature and hope for the futures.

 

In 1945, a few Miami activist staged a Wade-In at Bakers Haulover Beach, an all white beach to protest the segregation of Miami beaches.  The participants, who included notable community leaders, demanded that a public beach be made available to African-Americans in Miami-Dade County.  The City of Miami, in compliance with the 1896 Supreme Court Case, Plessey vs. Ferguson (Separate but Equal,) deemed Virginia Key Beach Park on Key Biscayne as a Colored Beach.

 

Why Virginia Key Beach?

The beach was on of the last stops on the Underground Railroad.  Here, Pirates ships would either transport slaves to the Bahamas, or other surrounding Caribbean islands; or recruit African-Americans into their crews, providing refuge from American slavery.

 

In the early 1900s Blacks boarded ferries downtown to sail to Virginia Beach, which was informally know as Bears Cut (The beach is actually located along Bears Cut, the channel that separates Virginia Key from Key Biscayne).  During the historic period, the name of the beach was Virginia Beach as opposed to its current name, Virginia Key Beach Park.

 

During the WWII the United States Navy, instituting segregation policies, have trained African-American and Hispanic- American service men who were not allowed to enter the same waters as white soldiers.

 

Virginia Beach, already meaningful and cherished amongst African-Americans, unofficially became the recreational center for the African-American community.  Many African-Americans traveled to the shoreline by boat for picnics, swimming, congregating and respite from the racially infused South.  For many reason, Virginia Beach was a logical and natural selection for the establishment of Miamis only Colored Beach.

      <Description>The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center, Inc. is a not-for-profit organization
dedicated to protecting the natural environment. This is accomplished through a two-fold effort: 

1. Offering environmental educational programs to private and public school systems.
These programs include laboratory and field study about the Biscayne Bay area and its vast
precious resources, including mangroves, sea grasses, the fossil rock reef, sand dunes and 
hammocks. We actively promote and encourage integration of environmental studies in the 
school system. 

2. Reaching out to encourage greater citizen awareness and participation in the protection of our 
natural environment. 
Various events hosted by the Biscayne Nature Center, such as our rotating art exhibits and 
"3rd. Fridays," are geared to introducing the center, and therefore our mission, to those visitors 
new to our center. We enjoy our environment, yet "leave no trace." 

The Biscayne Nature Center facilitates appreciation of our marine environment and humanity.

If you find you cannot attend, be sure to notify Jonna since we have a waiting list for this project.

  <Description>Would you like to be a part of HOMs leadership team? Then become a Volunteer Leader (VL)! VLs are an important part of Hands On Miamis Flexible Program, helping to organize and lead volunteers at each project. Without VLs, all the wonderful things that Hands On Miami does would not be possible. Being a VL is a great way to meet new people, gain new experiences, and discover your potential, as you make a difference in the lives of those we serve. 

Hands On Miami is looking for a few good Volunteer Leaders (actually more than a few!). Every time you see Volunteer Leader Still Needed in the newsletter, this is a project that may not be able to take place. We need you to step up and fill this role! Being a VL is a great resume-builder and allows you to develop leadership, organizational and management skills. At the same time, youll be able to have a greater impact on HOMs projects and help to meet important needs in Miami-Dade County. If you have energy, enthusiasm and a desire to lead others, then becoming a VL is for you! Join us for this informal session and learn what being a VL is all about. 

*For more information, including a list of projects that are currently in need of a Volunteer Leader, please contact Lucia Goyen at 305-646-7255 or lucia@handsonmiami.org.

PLEASE NOTE: Background checks are now required of all VLs. After you have completed training and the forms, you are required to do fingerprinting at a local police station and submit a $36.00 tax-deductible check, PAYABLE TO: Hands On Miami.

  <Description>We are looking for volunteer event coordinators or committee members. Dress is business casual and you are required to be passionate about the environment.

The purpose of this campaign is to:

Educate public about the adverse effects of plastic bags on the environment- made from petroleum, creates pollution, depletes natural resources, fatal consumption by animals, high costs in the long run to clean up litter, non-biodegradable 
Provide ways for public to make a difference- reduce, reuse, recycle! Activism! 
Inform public with most updated information about the anti-plastic issues 
Communicate with the public one-on-one to promote grass root organization 
Short term goal is to reduce, reuse, and recycle but in the long run hope to achieve a zero waste policy. 
"The leatherback turtle can keep itself warm in cold water, dive over 1000 meters below sea level, travel thousands of miles and gulp down a Portuguese man-of-war but is threatened by the inert plastic shopping bag" - Mrosovky, N. 1987

  <Description>Thank you for responding; we are in need of four adults that can lift approximately 50lbs.  This weight is highly unlikely as the move will be a group effort and involve empty desks, small hutches and boxes of office materials.  The date will be Friday, October 10th, beginning at 8:00 a.m. if possible.

      <Name>Rady Children's Hospital</Name>
      <Description>Rady Childrens is San Diego regions only designated pediatric trauma center and the only area hospital dedicated solely to pediatric care. Our goal is to help create a region where all children go to school healthy and ready to learn how to be productive, responsible citizens. Todays children are tomorrows leaders.

Quality pediatric care requires specialized training and a special sensitivity that is perfected through caring for children 100 percent of the time. From mild illness and injury to the most severe medical emergency, Rady Childrens specially qualified clinical staff and affiliated physicians provide a full continuum of care.

From birth through adolescence, children have special health care needs that are different from those of adults. Their bodies respond differently to injury and illness. And most children do not understand  or know how to deal with  the experience of serious illness or hospitalization. Rady Childrens responds to those needs by providing expert pediatric care within a unique healing environment.</Description>

  <Description>Volunteers are invited to help maintain a nesting site for endangered California Least Terns at Mariner's Point in Mission Bay. The work party is scheduled for Saturday, October 11, from 9am to noon. We'll be clearing the nesting site of invasive plants so the terns can use the site for nesting and rearing their young. 
Wear work clothes (long pants, long-sleeved shirt, hat, and sturdy shoes) and sunscreen. If you have them, bring work gloves and weeding tools or clippers. Snacks and water will be provided. 

The nesting site is jointly maintained by the San Diego Audubon Society, the City of San Diego, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. As required by the San Diego Park and Recreation Department, for volunteers 17 and under, a parent or guardian must sign a waiver for each child before the event. Children 13 and under must be accompanied by an adult. For more information, call Jim Peugh at (619) 224-4591 or the Mission Bay Park Rangers at (858) 581-7602. 

Directions to Mariner's Point: From Sea World Drive heading west, exit onto West Mission Bay Drive (going North). Continue over the bridge and then take a left on Gleason Road (across from the Bahia Hotel). Take an immediate left onto Mariners Way and proceed to the end of the road. (Thomas Bros. map, 1267-J3)

  <Description>ITVS and the INDEPENDENT LENS 2008-09 SEASON 
A Film Festival in your community!

Wake up, AmericaWere on the brink of a financial meltdown! Veteran filmmaker Patrick Creadon (WORDPLAY) boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its alarming consequences. As the Baby Boomer generation prepares to retire, will there be any Social Security benefits left to collect? Burdened with an ever-expanding government and military, overextended entitlement programs and debts to foreign countries, the film contends that America must mend its ways or face an economic disaster of epic proportions.

PLEASE NOTE: This is NOT a volunteer project. It is a film screening. You will get hours for attending.

Film Coordinator: Judie Stork, storkj@unitedwaymiami.org, 305-646-7462

  <Title>Pine Rockland Project (YVC Friendly)</Title>
  <DetailURL>http://www.HandsOnMiami.org/projects/viewProject.php?_mode=occurrenceView&_action=load&ixActivity=79294&_clearFlag=specialevent&_clearFlag=course&ixFeed=1</DetailURL>
  <Description>The institute for Regional Conservation's Ecological Restoration Volunteer Program is seeking volunteers to help restore the pine rockland habitat in Miami-Dade County. The pine rockland area has been reduced to less than two percent of its original extent by development, and only a few forest fragments remain. These forest fragments are home to many rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species that are nearing extinction. IRC's goal is to restore 50 to 60 acres of this habitat by engaging community volunteers to help with exotic plant removal and other restoration activities. Volunteers will also learn about the importance of this ecosystem from knowledgeable IRC Biologists.

PLEASE NOTE: While working at this project, volunteers may come in contact with poisonwood, a tree related to poison oak.  To help avoid skin contact with the tree, volunteers should wear long pants and have a long sleeve shirt available.  For general safety, volunteers should wear eye protection, gloves, and closed toed shoes.

YVC FRIENDLY: Youth volunteers can attend this project without an adult, if they are already a member of the Youth Volunteer Corps Program. To be a member of the YVC, please attend a HOM101 Orientation.

      <Name>All Aboard Tutoring Program</Name>
      <Description>All-Aboard Educational Services is a part of The Children's Psychiatric Center, Inc. (CPC), a private, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization. CPC offers a continuum of services including preventative and early intervention services, outpatient care, on-site care, day treatment, ambulant case management, residential care, and educational services.

All-Aboard was implemented in 1988 in response to a study conducted by the Unversity of South Florida which found that students who were retained once in kindergarten became 50% more likely to drop out of school by the age of sixteen. So, All-Aboard developed a tutoring and mentoring program to address the needs of academically at-risk kindergarten and first grade students in Miami-Dade County.</Description>

      <Description>About Historic Virginia Key Beach Park 

Listed on the U.S. Park Service National Register of Historic Places, the beach has a rich cultural history and played a significant role in the U.S. Civil Rights movement of South Florida.  Historic Virginia Key Beach Park is a treasured living legacy of land, history and beauty, past and future.  From the 1920s to the Civil Rights era, Historic Virginia Key Beach Park was a cherished getaway, religious sacred site and social gathering haven for Miamis Colored Community.  The Virginia Key Beach Park Trust has now been entrusted to oversee the restoration and development of the parkland site.  Historic Virginia Key Beach Park will offer a glimpse of the past, an appreciation for nature and hope for the futures.

 

In 1945, a few Miami activist staged a Wade-In at Bakers Haulover Beach, an all white beach to protest the segregation of Miami beaches.  The participants, who included notable community leaders, demanded that a public beach be made available to African-Americans in Miami-Dade County.  The City of Miami, in compliance with the 1896 Supreme Court Case, Plessey vs. Ferguson (Separate but Equal,) deemed Virginia Key Beach Park on Key Biscayne as a Colored Beach.

 

Why Virginia Key Beach?

The beach was on of the last stops on the Underground Railroad.  Here, Pirates ships would either transport slaves to the Bahamas, or other surrounding Caribbean islands; or recruit African-Americans into their crews, providing refuge from American slavery.

 

In the early 1900s Blacks boarded ferries downtown to sail to Virginia Beach, which was informally know as Bears Cut (The beach is actually located along Bears Cut, the channel that separates Virginia Key from Key Biscayne).  During the historic period, the name of the beach was Virginia Beach as opposed to its current name, Virginia Key Beach Park.

 

During the WWII the United States Navy, instituting segregation policies, have trained African-American and Hispanic- American service men who were not allowed to enter the same waters as white soldiers.

 

Virginia Beach, already meaningful and cherished amongst African-Americans, unofficially became the recreational center for the African-American community.  Many African-Americans traveled to the shoreline by boat for picnics, swimming, congregating and respite from the racially infused South.  For many reason, Virginia Beach was a logical and natural selection for the establishment of Miamis only Colored Beach.

      <Description>The idea behind Ronald McDonald House is simple: provide a home-away-from-home for families of seriously ill children who are receiving treatment at nearby hospitals.

Some children need to travel great distances to get the medical attention they need. In-hospital treatment may last one day, one year, or even longer. For the families of these children, accommodations can be hard to come by; options are often limited to costly hotels or unforgiving hospital chairs and benches.

The Ronald McDonald House provides a comfortable, supportive alternative for these families. It serves as a temporary residence near the medical facility where family members can sleep, eat, relax and find support from other families in similar situations.</Description>

HABITAT FOR HUMANITYS CONSTRUCTION SAFETY POLICY
Safety is everybodys concern and is always an import consideration at any construction site. Building construction can be one of the most dangerous occupations. Since Habitat work crews normally have a high proportion of inexperienced people, everyone must pay particular attention to safety. Try to be conscious of the safety of others as well as yourself. An observer can often see danger better than the worker involved in the project. Be cautious at all times and ask questions. Do not go ahead with a task if you are uncertain how it is done, or if you are unable to do it. Safety is based on knowledge, skill and an attitude of care and concern. Supervisors should instruct each worker about the correct and proper procedures for performing each task. This should familiarize the worker with the potential hazards of doing the tasks and advise him or her as to how such hazards can be minimized or eliminated. It is very important that we at Habitat know about safe work practices and follow them.

Guidelines for a safe attitude:
1. THINK before you do your work or task.
2. If you are uncertain about how to do a task or how to operate a power tool  ASK A SUPERVISOR.
3. Concentrate on your task and eliminate distractions.
4. Know where the first aid kit is located and how to get emergency help.
5. Inspect all power tools, hand tools, ladders and scaffolding on a daily basis.
6. Advise your supervisor IMMEDIATELY of any safe or hazardous tool or
condition.

Proper Safety Equipment:
 Proper clothing is essential to safety as the proper selection and use of tools.
 Wear clothes and gloves that are appropriate for the work and weather
conditions.
 Loose clothing is dangerous around power tools.
 Workers shall wear work boots or thick soled shoes at all times when on a construction site.
 Any worker wearing sandals or other types of inappropriate footwear shall not be permitted to remain on a construction site.
 Hard hats are to be worn while doing demolition work, during the framing phase of construction, or when required by a supervisor, and are to be made available to workers on each job site at all times.
 Protective glasses will be available for every construction worker.
 A worker must wear protective glasses any time he or she is operating a power tool or when instructed by a supervisor.
 Each worker must wear a dust mask when installing insulation, sanding or when instructed by a supervisor.
 Ear plugs must be worn when using a power tool for a prolonged period of time or when instructed by a supervisor.
 Ear plugs are to be made available to workers on each job site at all times.

Power tools and other electrical equipment:
 A power tool should not be used without proper instruction on its use and on what can happen if the tool is not used properly.
 The instruction should be done by a qualified person and should be given to all workers; even experienced do-it-yourselfers should receive instruction.
 The trainee should use the power tool in the presence of the instructor, until the
instructor is satisfied that the trainee knows how to use the power tool properly.
 Never lower or carry a power tool by its cord. Clean tools daily.
 Power tools should be checked for defective switches, cords, plugs, and proper grounding.
 Defective tools should not be used and should either be reported to the
supervisor or labeled and taken to the tool room for repair immediately. (Do not wait until the end of the day).
 To avoid electrical shock, the following rules must be obeyed:
1. A three pronged plug must be used on all electric power tools.
2. Extension cords must not have frayed insulation or be fastened with staples, hung from nails or suspended from wires.
3. All temporary lights must be equipped with non-conductive guards.

HANDS TOOLS:
 Always select the correct type and size of tool for your work and be sure it is sharp and properly adjusted.
 Guard against using any tool if the handle is loose or in poor condition.
 Dull tools are hazardous to use because excessive force must be used to make them cut. Oil or dirt on a tool may cause it to slip and cause an injury.
 When you are using tools, hold them correctly. Most edged tools should be held in both hands with the cutting action away from yourself.
 Avoid using your hand or fingers as a guide to start a cut, but if it is necessary, use extreme caution.
 Handle and carry tools with care. Keep edged and pointed tool turned
downward.
 Carry only a few tools at one time unless they are mounted in a special holder or carried in a tool belt.
 Anyone working with a hammer at a height should wear a hammer loop or tool belt, and, when not in use, the hammer should be kept in the loop or belt and not placed on a sloping surface or in a precarious position.
 Do not carry sharp tools in your pockets. When not in use, tools should be kept in special boxes, chests or cabinets.
 A special word on saws:
1. Dont bind the blade of any saw. When cutting long panels, the blade may bind, and the saw mill will catch and kick back toward the operator. Use small wood wedges or shim shingles to spread the saw cut as you go along.
2. Maintain the blade guard. A spring-actuated blade guard often can become bent and wont slide quickly, or the spring can become stretched so the return is slow. Repair any damage to the guard as soon as it happens, and NEVER tie the
guard back out of the way.
3. Support what you are working on properly. Never attempt to cut something that could tilt or all and cause the saw to slip.

LADDERS:
 Inspect a ladder before you use it. If the ladder is unsafe, dont use it. Look for wear and tear, loose rungs and defects.
 Use a ladder that will reach the work An extension ladder should reach 3 feet above the work level.
 Move your ladder with your work. If both your shoulders are extended outside the ladder while you are working, you are reaching too far.
 When using an extension ladder, use the 4-to-1 rule: for every 4 feet of height, move the bottom of the ladder 1 foot away from the wall.
 A ladder is pitched at the proper, safe angle if you can grasp a rung at shoulder height.
 Place your ladder on solid footing. If there is a danger of the ladder moving while you work, tie it down.
 If there is a danger that the ladder will be hit, barricade it. If the feet of the ladder are not level, dig the ground out under one foot with the claw of a hammer rather than raise one foot with blocks.
 Never use an aluminum ladder in the vicinity of electrical lines and never use a ladder outdoors during inclement weather or on very windy days.
 Carry tools and materials in proper carrying devices and keep your hands free for climbing. When climbing, always face the ladder.

SCAFFOLDING:
 All scaffolding that is elevated 10 feet or more must be equipped with a safety railing.
 All scaffolds must be equipped with a toe board to eliminate the possibility that tools or debris will be kicked or pushed onto people below.
 A scaffold must be designed to support four times the weight of the workers and the materials resting on it.
 Scaffolding components that are not designed to be compatible should not be
mixed.
 Inspect all scaffolding each day before using it. Never use damaged or defective equipment and avoid rusted parts since their strength is unknown
 When erecting scaffolding, provide adequate sills for the scaffold posts and use base plates. Use adjusting screws, not blocks, when on an uneven grade.
 Make sure to plumb and level scaffolding and do not force end braces when constructing the scaffolding.
 Many scaffolding accidents are caused by defective planking. Use only properly graded and inspected lumber for planking.
 Inspect planking daily for splits and knots, and remove defective or damaged planking.

CLEAN WORK SITE:
 A clean work place is a safe work place. This refers to the neatness and good order of the construction site. Maintaining good housekeeping contributes to the efficiency of the worker and is important in preventing accidents.
 Position building materials and supplies in carefully laid out piles to allow adequate aisles and walkways.
 Clean up all rubbish and scrap materials on a daily basis.
 Do not permit blocks of wood, nails, bolts, empty cans, pipe, wire or other
materials to accumulate on the work site. They interfere with work and can
constitute a hazard.
 Keep tools and equipment not being used in chests, panels or tool boxes. This protects the tools and the workers.
 Never leave a work site unguarded unless all tools and materials have been properly secured.

POISONS and TOXIC SUBSTACNES:
 The poisons and toxic substances that can be found on a work site are asbestos, lead oxides, solvents and animal feces. Special care must be taken when you come in contact with any of these substances or any unfamiliar substance.
 If you discover asbestos fiber being used as pipe, boiler or heating duct
insulation, contact your supervisor immediately. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
REMOVE THE ASBESTOS FIBER ON YOUR OWN.
 Scraping exterior woodwork, demolishing lead-painted walls and stripping old mill work are the principal ways that workers can be exposed to lead chips, dust and particles. Contact your supervisor immediately if you discover any lead-painted surfaces.
 Masks are the best protection against breathing germs that can be borne in dust containing animal feces (such as rodent droppings).

EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE:
If someone is injured on the job, contact your supervisor immediately and summon any needed medical help. You also should use the supplies located in the first-aid kit to stabilize the injury as much as possible until medical help arrives. Your supervisor is trained in first-aid and will help any injured worker. Insurance forms necessary to obtain emergency medical care are located in every first aid kit.
